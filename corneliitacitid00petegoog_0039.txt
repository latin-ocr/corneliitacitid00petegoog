xxvi ’ INTRODUCTION.

compositions of former days, with their intricate arrangement and
technical divisions-the ‘book-speeches' made to order according to
the precepts of Hermagoras and Apollodorus—must give place to the
animation and refinement (laetitiam et pulchritudinem autumi) that have
now become indispensable: nouis et exquiritur eloquentiae itineribus epus
est per quae arator fastidium aureum effugiat. Finishing with a short
review of the enn'que' (al-23), Aper contends that the Ciceronian
age is really overrated: Calvus, Caelius, Caesar, Brutus, Asinius Pollio,
Messalla, Corvinus and Cicero himself, are weighed in the balance and
. found wanting. In one case the diction is slovenly (sordes verberum),
and the rhythm defective (huns canpaseteb): in others there is a want ol
the ‘buoyancy and polish' that mark present-day eloquence (laetriiam
nitoremque nostrarum temporum). When those who confine their ad·
miration to the past praise its speakers for their ‘sound, pure style,'
they only confess that these speakers were wanting in vigour: parurn est
aegrum non esse,sartem et laetum et alacrem uelo: prope abest ab infirmtiate
in qua sala santius laudatur.

When Aper has finished Maternus (while complimenting him on his
spirited and ingenious deience of his own age) calls on Messalla to fulfil
his promise to set forth the causes of a decline which he himself regards
as an established fact. Messalla's speech (25-27) consists of a vigorous ,
vindication of the antiqui from Aper’s accusationS, and an attack on
the ‘curling-tongs and jingle·jingle' (calamzitrar et tinnulus) of such
later speakers as Maecenas and Gallio, with a general impeachment of
his own times as degenerate and effeminate. He is prepared to cite
examples from the past, and match them against any which Aper may
put forward; but Maternus again interrupta, and recalls the speaker to
the original theme. It is the explanation of the phenomenon, he says
that they wish to have from him, not a mere statement of fact. Messalla
then proceeds (ch. 28) to uufold the causes of the decline of eloquence
from two points of view, taking first the methods of early nurture and
theoretical training which obtained in former dayS, and contrasting them ’
with the laxity and indifference of his own time (aa-32), and then, after
a few remarks from Maternus, comparing also the practical exercises
,of the antiqui with those of the noui (33-35).

It is in this part oi the treatise that the author of the Dialogue first
begins to discuss directly the answer to the question announced in the
opening sentence. That Messalla is meant to appear as a ‘laudator
temporis acti' is obvious from the fact that he leads off by at once attri-
buting the decline, not only of eloquence, but of the other arts as well to
