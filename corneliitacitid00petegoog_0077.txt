of the hitherto undiscovered writings of Tacitus. A certain monk, who
was charged with important business at the Papal Court, had once
intimated to him that he knew where several volumes were to be found,
one of which contained what Poggio designates as aliqua opera Cornelii
Taciti nabis ignata-probably the codex in which the minor works
afterwards came to light. The monk, who had doubtless a proper
appreciation of Poggio's influence at court, as well as of his weakness for
old manuscripts, undertook to fumish him with a list of books belonging
to the library of an ancient German monastery, inventarium cuiusdam
uetustissimi manasterii in Germania, ubi est ingens librorum copia. In
1427 the monh, now described as ‘of Hersfeld’ (Hersfeldensis) brings
the promised inventory, with which Poggio is greatly disappointed. Part
of it, however, he forwards to Niccolo: Mi'tto autem ad te nunc partem
inventarii sui, in quo describitur volumen i'llud Cornelii Taci'ti et abarum
quibus caremus: quaecum sint res quaedam parvulae, nou ratiis magm' sunt
aestimandae. Deci'diix magna spe quam conceperam ex verbis suis. The
monk promised to bring him the Tacitus codex, and Poggio waited
impatiently for it. But it did not arrive. In the end of 1428 he writes
to Niccoli, Cornelius Tacitus si'lct inter Germanas neque quicquam exinde
nani percepi dc eiius operibus. The Hersfeld brother came again to Rome,
but without the wished-for codex, whereupon Poggio gave him awarm
reception. He undertook to bring it on his next journey ; butas Poggio
makes no further allusion to the matter in his correspondence, we are
led to conclude that the monk's tergiversation compelled him to abandon
the hope he had entertained so long.

It is of course impossible now to identify the codex to which this
incident relates, but we may infer with some probability that it was the
one afterwards brought to light by Enoch oi Ascoli. Only one copy of
the Dialoguc, along with the Germania and the fragment of Suetonius
de Grammaticis it Rhetoribus, is known to have survived down to the
days of Poggio. It became the parent of the various MSS. of those
treatises which we now possess, and which can all be proved to derive
from it and it only ². It was the discovery of this codex, in a German
monastery, that rewarded Enoch's later journeyings, after his first patron
Nicholas V had passed away. The authority for this statement is a note

ι which, when he published his edition of the Germania and the Dialogus in

1841, L. Tross reported from the Leyden codex (B). This note was ’
appended byJovianus Pontinus (1426-1503) to the original of which the
Leyden MS. is a copy, and is to the effect that Enoch’s codex came to
