These notices may be taken as fixing the date of Enoch's discovery,
approximately, at 1458 ¹. But though the date may be regarded as
settled, other important points in the accounts we have remain still to be
discussed. Where was the monastery in which Enoch found the codex
in question? -What was the relation of this codex to the other known
codices containing the historical books of Tacitus? Did Enoch bring the
original with him to Rome, or only a copy?

Three monasteries have been named as containing the library in which
Enoch had his one great stroke of good fortune-those of Corvey in
westphalia, F ulda in flesse-Cassel, and Hersfeld in the same neighbour-
hood. In regard to the first-mentioned, no argument can be founded

on the letter addressed by Poggio to Niccoli, in which he names this
monastery: nam da manasterio Corbn'a quad est in Germania nan estquod
sperem dz'cr'lur multas esse in aa libras: non creda rumoribus stultarum.
This was in 1420, several years before Poggio commenced his negotia·
tions with the Hersfeld monk. On the other hand, Corvey is almost
certainly known to have been the home of the codex now known as the F irst
Medicean, before it was abstracted and conveyed to Rome in the early

years of the sixteenth century. But it was from Hersfeld that the monk
came, and the volumes which he held out the prospect of to the expectant
Poggio were not improbably in the library which he knew best—that of
his own monastery. The reason why he sailed to implement his promise
may have been either that Poggio did not offer enough ², or that he
found his business prospering at Rome without Poggio's help. On the

Voigt (see op. cit. i. 258, note) thinks Enoch is believed to have returned to
