Vergil, ch. 31, and Macrob. i. 24, 11 s
annihilabant tinient:
torum reliquiae, i. p. 159.

7. versibus. The reference to the
poet's accidental presence at the perform-
ance makes it probable that some lines
srom one oi his well-known works had
chanced to be quoted in the course oi a
dramatic representation. Otherwise we
know from Donatus (Lite, ch. 26) and
lrom Servius (on Ecl. vi. 11) that Vergil's
Eclogues, particularly the Sixth, were
often rendered on the stage, probably as
interludes: it this is what is meant here,
forte may refer to the fact that the poet
was not usually resident in Rome.

8. spectantem defines praesentem
more nearly: Vergil was present as a
spectator. .For the repetition of the
name, which is omitted by some editors,
cp. Hist. ii. 101, 5ne ab aliis apud Vitel-
lium anteirentur, pervertisse ipsum Vitel-
lium videntur: Ann. xii. 64, 10 perdita

viderim longe princeps Pomponius Secun-
dus, quem senes quidem parum tragicum
putabant, eruditione ac nitore praestare
confitebantur. The fact that he was a
man oi affairs as well as a poet is oiten s
alluded to : cp. Plin. vii. ξ 8ο in Pomponio
consulari poeta: xiii. 5 83 apud P. S.,
vatem civemque clarissimum. His friend,
Pliny the Elder, wrote his lite in two
books: see Plin. Ep. iii. 5.

Afro Domitio. The same inversion ¹
occurs in Quint. x. 1, 86. ln ξ 118 Quin-
tilian ranks him, along with Iulius Airi-
canus, far above all contemporary orators :

Afer was a native of Nismes, and first
acquired repnte by the prosecution oi
Agrippina’s cousin Claudia Pulchra: Ti·
berius declared that he was a ‘ born orator’
(suo iure disertum, Anu. iv. 52, 18). He
was Quintilian’s tencher and model: v.
7,7: Plin. Ep. ii. 14.

10. dignitate vitas: Tacitus tells us
in the Annals (l. c.) that he was nnscru-
pulous, ‘modicus dignationis et quoquo
facinore properus clarescere! He placed

about Augustus's displeasure when it was perpetuitate famae. Quintilian tells

this success he obtained from Claudius crispus iste st Marcellus: see on
the ‘ornamenta triumphalia‚' but Tacitus 8. 1 and 5. 31.
