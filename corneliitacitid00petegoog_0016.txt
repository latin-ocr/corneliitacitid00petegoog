THE QUESTION OF AUTHORSHIP ΛΝΒ DATE. iii

owe its survival, had evidently proclaimed itself to be the work of Tacitus,
would have been either accepted without cavil and criticism or boldly
denounced as aforgery and a fraud. Habent rua sata libelli. At first,
indeed, the Dialogus was unhesitatingly included, along with the other
writings of the historian, so far as then known, in the editio princeps, pub·
lished by Vendelin de Spira at Venice in 1470. This was within some
twelve or thirteen years of its re-appearance. But when the discovery, in
1508, of the first six books of the Annals had given fresh evidence not
only of the historical bent of the genius of Tacitus, but also of the peculiar
individuality of his style, doubts began to be entertained. It seemed
difficult to believe that the easy and flowing language of the Dz'alogue
could rightly be attributed to the writer who had employed what was
almost-a new method of literary expression in the terse, pointed, and¹
pregnant phraseology of the Annals. And as the codex from which his
minor works had been recovered contained also treatises by other authors,
including Suetonius's fragment De Grammatrlt'r et Rhetoribus, it was
supposed that the ascription of the Dialogus to Tacitus in the title,
might be the mistake ofa scribe, who had inadvertently confounded with
the writer of the Agricola and the Germania the author of a work on
altogether different lines which it had been found convenient, at some
time or other, to include ina single codex along with these. The earliest
literary expression of these scruples is to be found in the edition of
Beatus Rhenanus (Bilde of Rheinau in Elsass) which appeared at Bere in
1519 and again in 1533. Rhenanus inclined to believe that the Dialogue
was a comparatively late work, which had been skilfully invested with the .
appearance of antiquity by the introduction of personages and events
belonging to the age of Tacitus. But he gave only an uncertain sound.
His half-hearted deliverance—Hunc dralogum ar'or credz'rlem'm esse Taciti
—had nothing like the effect on contemporary opinion that was afterwards
produced by the more pronounced scepticism of the great Dutch scholar
J. Lipsius. In the preface tobis famous edition of the year 1574,
Lipsius declared against the Tacitean authorship with all the confidence
of an inspired literary oracle (tam certum. . . quam si respondriret
Apollo). His main ground was that which has been founded on ever
since, the obvious difference of style: stolus valde abnuet, non fallax in
lroc genere argumentum, quiin nostro constrictus aliaue, teres, acutus et
severus magis quam lapillus, hic omnia contra. To the argument that
style may vary with a writer's advance in years and with the subject of
which he treats Lipsius replied that such change is possible only within
certain limits, never to the extent of a complete transformation (noor-

quam ita ul prorsus abeat α’ sese). He did not hesitate, however, to class
