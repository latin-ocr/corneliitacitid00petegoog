the pieee. In regard to this point, the interpretation of ch. 1. rr (eum
singuli diuersas quidem sed probabiles causas adferrent, dunt brumam sui
quisque et anriuiet engenii redderent) is of ' the greatest importanee. To
exclude Secundus from the reference here, would be to practically limit
it to Messalla and Maternus: on the strictest interpretation of debersos
causas aefferre—oecurring as this phrase does after eandem hanc quaes·
tionem (cp. 1. r) pertractantes-Aper does not seem to come in, because
it is nothis province to suggest any causae for a decline which he does
not admit ¹. Again, if the lacuna really extends over about one-ninth
of the whole treatise²‚ it is difficult to imagine what it can have con·
tained except on the theory that Secundus also spoke⁸. Messalla cannot
have gone on much longer. His subject had been prescribed for him
by Maternus in ch. 33. 8 quibus exercitationibus invenes tarn et sorum
¹ ingressuri confirmare et alere ingentii suo soliti sz'nt3 and unless he
elaborated the criticism of contemporary methods with which his speech
breaks off, that subject may be said to have been overtaken before the
lacuna occurs. On the other hand, it is argued that it is more con-
sistent with what we know of the retiring and unwarlike⁴ disposition
of Secundus to conceive him as confining himself to assisting the progress
of the action by appropriate interpellations: also that no reference is
made to him in the closing chapter, where Maternus, Messalla, and Aper
bring the discussion to a close. The theory that we actually have part
ofa speech by Secundus in what follows after the lacuna, will be better
dealt with in connexion with Maternus.

The fourth and last of the interlocutors in the Dialogue, Curiatius
Maternus, is the most interesting of all. The author obviously intended
to put him forward as the leading personage of the picce. It is in his
house that the discussion takes place. He is introduced as a well-known
celebrity, who does not stand in need of even the brief characterization

that so important a disputant as Aper to explain the phrase diuersas causus in
