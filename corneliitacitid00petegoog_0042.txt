‘SUBSTANCE AND SCHEME OF THE DIALOGUE. xxix

incidents as these, however regrettable in themselves, were far more
inspiring than the routine practice of police-courts and petty-sessions.
Political and social disturbance is the best stimulant for oratory. Every
one knows that peace is to be preferred to war; but it is war that brings
out the soldier. So it is with eloquence (chs. 37, 38).

Again, the forms of judiclal procedure and the practice of the law·
courts were more conducive to good speaking in former days. Then
a pleader could take as much time as he liked, and there was a very
wide freedom of adjournment. And the centumviral comta-the great
sphere of forensic oratory now,-were formerly of little account: they
were eclipsed by the brilliant surroundings of other tribunals (splendore
alibrum iudiciorum obruebantur). Morever, the habit of speaking in
the paenula, and in chambers or offices, is not favourable to oratorical ·
animation. The stimulus of an audience is wanting, and the incitement
of applause: things are not now as they were in the days when the
forum was crowded with an interested assemblage, when deputations
came up from the country-towns to show their interest in a case—cum
in plerisque rudicir's crederet populus Romanus sua interesse quid iudicaretur.
And in former times the frequent public meetings, and the notoriety to
be gained by the impeachment of distinguished individuals, supplied
agreat stimulus. Again must the truth be stated: eloquence thrives
on disorder. Non de otiosa et quieta re loquimur et quae probitate et
modestia gaudeat, sed est magna illa et notabilis eloquentia alumna licentiae,
quam stulti libertatem uocabant, comes seditionum, effrenati populi incitamen-
tum, sine obsequio, sine unitate, contumax, temeraria, adrogans, quaein
bene constitutis cruciatibus non oritur. At Athens, where power lay in
the hands of the multitude, orators were numerous ; at Rome, in earlier
days, there was greater oratorical vigour, but the country had a heavy
price to pay in the attempted revolution of the Gracchi and in the
death of Cicero (chs. 39, 40).

From this point of view, the surviving traces of the old forum are only
a proof ofa society that falls short of ideal perfection. In the ideal
state, free from all taint of wrong-doing, the orator will be as super-
fluous as the physician among those that are not sick. bfrnor oratorum
bonor obscuriorque glarea est inter bonos mores et in obsequium regentis
paratas. The transference of power from the popular assembly to the
emperor (sapientissimus et unus), with all the consequent changes, has con-
tracted the sphere of eloquence. Circumstances alter cases If you, my
friends (the speaker concludes), had lived under the republlc, and if the old
orators had changed places with you, you could not have failed to
achieve the highest oratoricaf renown, while they would not have been
