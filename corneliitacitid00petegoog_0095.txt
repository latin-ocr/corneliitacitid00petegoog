‘lxxxii INTRODUCTION.

evidence, both external and· internal, is against such a theory. The
probable character of the sequel ol Messalla's speech, and of what must
- have preceded ch. 36 in the archetype has already been discussed ¹. As
regards the extemal evidence, there is a pretty general agreement among
the MSS. that the lacuna under consideration extended to six folios
of the archetype, which had evidently been lost before the first copy was
taken from Enoch’s find ². The proportion of the lost part to the whole
has been variously calculated. Urlichs (Eos, ii. p. 232) thought it must
have been one-tenth3 Brotier, who undertook to supply what was wanting
ina ‘supplementum' took it at one-sixth3 Habbe³ has calculated it at
one-seventh, arguing that the ‘sex pagelle' of the MSS. must refer to the ·
folios of the original ‘archetypum Fuldense,' from which what is known
now as the First Medicean is believed to have been copied. Α constituent
part of this last-named MS, though separated from it now, is the Medicean
codex of Pliny’s Letters, and Habbe believes that a comparison of a mar-
ginal note in the Vatican codex of Pliny (3864), which states the extent
of the lacuna in the sixteenth letter of the first book as ‘duae chartae,'
will give the result as above calculated for the Dialogue. In the Har·
lechnus, the copyist has carefully calculated the extent of the lacuna in the
codex which lay before him, and has left blank a space corresponding to
about one-ninth of the whole, no doubt in the hope that the missing part
, would one day turn up, when it could be incorporated with the rest.

· In discussing the question whether the manuscripts of the X family, or “
those which derive from Y, are the more to be depended on for a scientific
reconstitution of the text, careful note must be taken of their distin·
guishing characteristics. There can be no doubt that the copyist of Y
had a better knowledge of Latin than the copyist of X, and was also more
skilled in the solution of the various compendia which must have abounded
in the archetype. Moreovcr, he was not content to follow his original
to the very letter, especially where he thought he could improve on it:
hence the MSS. which derive from Y show traces of a process of emenda·
tion which had began, in all probability, with the writer of Y himself.
