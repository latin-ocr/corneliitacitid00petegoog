MANUS CRIPTS, lxxxv

26. 23 uelut EV,CAH (and corr. B) vult AB ⁷
26. 2411ineusat0 Ev2ca in Curato Α, inaurato BD,

in curato H
29. 12 invenies Ev,ca1)H invenires AB
35. 16 perfidem EV2CAD perfidie ΑΒΗ

Probability is strongly in favour also oi:-

24. 12 in tautum EV2CAH as against tantum AB ³ ’

37319¹habendus Ev2ca ,‚ - habendus est ABH (est habendule)
41.9 tamen Ev,ca1)H „ indeAB

Here are two cases oi transposition, in regard to which the superiority
oi the Y reading is argned in the notes :—

enchon ’ .. ΑΒ
“ ’ 224 eiusdem aetatis oratores oratores eiusdem aetatis
227 saniarium1 Α iam senior
Cp. also 30. 20 ingenuae artis , artes ingenuae

It is probably the superior knowledge os the copyist that'isy de·
monstrated in :— ·· ..

23. 1 ius verm'num EV2CADH as against ius netm’num AB

5.6 SaleiumV2CADH,SeleiumE „ Salerum A, dalenuss ,ἵ ²:
9.9 Saleium EV2CAH, Sellium D „ Caeleium A, CoeteiumB '¹

When we come to examine the places where the correct reading seems
to have depended on the copyist's ,ability to interpret compendia and
terminal abbreviations, we find a very considerable advantage on the
side of the Y family. It should be remembered‚ however, that this is
in itseli no proof of the superiority oi Y over Χ. The following isli list
of the readings which are rightly given by the descendants ol Y τέ 1 ’

2. 14 omni Ev,ca , ’ cu ABDH Ι
5.15 necessitudines EV2CAD necessitates AB (uatt'ones H, edd. vett.)
5. 2 5 perfugio EV2CAD profugio AB (praestitio H, edd. vett.)
6. 18 quemcunque C, quancun- ¹quandocunque AB (quacunque H, and
que E, quemconque D, b in marg.)
Ἰ, quecqu2
7. 15 nomina EV2CADH nd AB
9. 10 eius EV2CAD (om. H) est AB
9. 21 praecepta EV2dD percepta ABCH

¹ Gndeman supports the reading oi ibe to combine with et, ac, ut, mn, nisi, si,
Y class here by pointing out that ‘omit que, and the like’ the postpositive nse os
ting such stereotype collocatione asiam iam is the general rule in the Dialogue.
vero, iem pridem, iam dudum, and Such instances, however, as32. 303 7.17;
observing that aem has a decided tendency 8. 173 32. 303 99. 6, are not tothe point.
