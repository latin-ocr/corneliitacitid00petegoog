xxviii INTRODUCTION.

declamation¹l No sufficient preparation can be provided there for the
concrete issues of actual experience. . . .

Here Messalla's speech breaks off abruptly. The rest of it is lost in
a lacuna which the indications of the manuscripts enable usto infer²
must have originally contained about one-ninth part of the whole trea-
tise. The next speaker begins in the middle of a sentence, as Messalla
had left off. His identity will be discussed below, as well as the various
theories put forward by editors and 'critics as to the distribution of
parts in this last section of the Deirlogue³z meanwhile the speech
may be treated as forming (after the lost introduction) a continuous whole
(chs. 36-41). .

Its main purpose is to emphasize the fact that the conditions of the

. political constitution of the old free-state were more favourable for the

growth and development of eloquence: though it does not conclude with-
out a reference to the compensating advantages which are secured by
a more stable form of govemment. In the first place, eloquence was
a much larger factor then than it is now: like fire, it needs fuel to feed it,
and in those troublous times (illa perturbatione uc le'cente'a) there was fuel
in abundance. This was the speaker's opportunity: a career was open
to him so long as power rested with the fickle populace, whose judgment

he could sway by his eloquence. We see now how distracting it all was
to the country; but what else could have provided the orator with the
field he needs? Where else was he to look for such rich rewards?
Eloquence was, in fact, a necessary and indispensable passport to
public life. No one could get on without it. And the sphere of
oratory was far greater and more important then than now. Bribery at
elections, the pillaging of provinces, the butchery of fellow-citizens-sucb
