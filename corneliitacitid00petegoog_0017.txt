the Dialogue with the best works ol its kind, as a genuine monument oi
classical antiquity‚ At first he thought that he had discovered init Quin-
tilian's lost treatise, De causr's corruptae eloquentiae¹; and accordingly
the title under which the work appeared in his original Antwerp edition
was ‘Fan Quintiliani, ut eviletur, Dialogus au sui saeculi aratores et quare
concedant: Cornele'o Tacito falsa inscriptus! But as Quintilian was born
about 35 A.1>., he could hardly have described himself as being still
¹iuuenis admodum (Dial. 1. 12) in 74-7 5 nn, the year in which the conver-
sation out oi which the De'alague resulted is generally understood to have
taken place. This consideration was in itself enough to shake, even in
his own mind, the view to which Lipsius had given a perhaps too hasty

“ expression3 and so in subsequent issues of his work Tacito uulgo

incernatur takes the place oi Tace‘ta falso inscriptus, while in his third
(Leyden) edition of 1585, he states his doubts about Quintilian, though still
convinced of the difficulties in the way oi the traditional view. Lipsius’s
final attitude was, in lact, that which is adopted by more than one critic
of the present day-a judicial Nou le'quet.

But though he 'expressly disclaimed any wish to impose his own
opinions on his contemporaries or successors (aelel altit praeeo quad
sequantur), the authority of his great name sufficed to induce a general
suspension ofjudgement during the two centuries which succeeded his
epoch. Some scholars adhered to the Tacitean tradition, others advocated
Quintilian²: some took a new departure, ascribing the Dzalagae to the
younger Pliny, orto Suetonius or to the poet-pleader who is its central
figure, Curiatius Maternus. But Pliny could only haye been thirteen
years of age when he is supposed to have been present at the conversa-
tion reported in the treatise: Suetonius is chronologically still more
impossible: while the theory about Maternus is altogether inconsistent
with the ‘setting' of the De'alagua which purports to be written by one
who, so sar from taking a leading part in the conversation narrated, had
been merely a listener to the views of others ³. The safest position was
