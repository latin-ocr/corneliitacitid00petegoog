SUBSTANCE AND SCHEME OF THE DIALOGUE'. xxvii

moris antiqm'. In former days, he says, children were brought up by their
own mothers, who exercised a watchful care that was afterwards fruitful
in results: suus cuiqm filius . . . non in cella emptae nutricii, sed in gremio
ac sinu matres educabatur, curaspraecipua laus erat tmm'domum cl mscrm're
liberis. But now they are handed over to Greek nurses and pedagogues,
whose worthless characters are speedily reflected in the minds of their
charges. Moral supervision on the part of parents is a thing of the
past: indeed their influence is rather the other way. Next Messalla
complains that a narrow training in rhetoric has been substituted ior
that wide philosophica] culture which was the strength of the speakers of
bye·g0ne days Seeing that the orator is one who must be able to
speak fitly and persuasively on any and every topic, he ought to receive
the broadest possible education, including law and history, philosophy
and science. The neglect of what made Cicero great is, in Messalla's
judgment, the first and foremost reason of the decay of eloquence: crgo
hanc premam et praecipuam causam arbitror cur in tamtum ab eloquentie
ante'qmrum oratorum recesseramus. There are others, but these he will
leave his friends to explain. Maternus however (ch. 33), suggests that the
contrast he has laid down between the ignorant apathy of his own day

and the enthusiastic and fruitful application of the ancients (dffrmttbm

nostrae desidiae et inscitiae adversus acerrima etscmndisstma mrum studea)
ought to be followed up by a comparison of the practical exercises (exerci-
tationes) formerly engaged in by aspirants to oratorical fame with those to
which they are confined and limited now. What should be the character
of the training which is meant to serve as a practical preparation for the
exercise of the barrister's profession? This leads Messalla to paint a
vivid picture (34) of the Roman youth of former days, who after the most
carehrl home-mining, and instruction in all the branches of a liberal
education (imbutus-mm domestica disciplima, refertus honestis studiis) was
introduced by his father or some other relative to one of the most
eminent orators and statesmen of the day, under whose immediate
auspices he speedily acquired familiarity with the actual practice of his
profession. He learned his craft under a master's eye, studying it, not in
any cloistered retreat, but in the open light of day, and face to face with
critical situations (in medea luce atque inter ipso descrimine). It was on
the battle-field, in fact, that he received lessons in the art of war (pugnare
in proelio discedat). What a contrast between the great opportunities
thus affordcd of drinking at the well of eloquence pure and undefiled,
gauging the popular taste, and gaining experience of real issues-and
the narrowing influences of the school of rhetoric, with its unedi·
fying companionship, its artificial methods, its stock subJ'ects for empty
