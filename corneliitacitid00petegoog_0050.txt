THE INTERLOCUYORS ANB THEIR PARTS. xxxvii -

which is given in the same chapter to his two visitors, Aper and
Secundus His tragedies are made the occasion of the discussion which
forms the first part of the treatise3 and it is certain-no matter what
theory of the arrangement of parts may be adopted—that it was he who
contributed the closing speech (42 blaterat Maternus). Itis he also
who guides and controls the development of the discussion, speaking in
ch. 16 for Secundus as weil as for himself, bringing out the real points
at issue in ch. 24, recalling Messalla to it in ch 27, and prevailing
on him to continue his speech in ch. 33. As one who has been both
a poet and a pleader, he is well qualified to decide between the rival
attractions os the two professions. Already under Nero (ll. 9) he had
distinguished himself by writing a tragedy, which seems not to have
been without some practical result 3 and another tragedy-the ‘Cato '—
was now the topic of‘general conversation at Rome. But his resolution
has been taken. He intends to forsake the profession of advocate (ac
ram me derangere a sorensi labore constzlut', 11. 12)and to devote himself
wholly to the pursuit of poetry. Nothing that Aper can urge will shake
him from his purpose. How long he lived to give effect to it is a matter
of uncertainty. A passage from Dio Cassius¹ has been quoted by many
critics as proving that he lived till 91 a. o, when he was put to death by
Domitian for undue freedom of speech. But Maternus was a common
name in imperial times, and the reference may be to another person
altogether. If he had been the Maternus of the Dtblogue, it is unlikely
that he would have been designated a ‘sophist,' and as practising
declamation‚ so long after he had resigned the profession of advocate
in favour of poetry. The argument, however, has served to increase
the difficulty as to Matemus's personality, and to complicate the question

of the Tacitean authorship of the treatise. It has been contended² that
Tacitus would not have ventured, in the reign of Domitian and during

the lifetime of Matemus‚ to attribute to the latter sentiments which seem,
at times, almost to anticipate the fate that is said to have afterwards

’ overtaken him. It is just as probabfe, however, that the Maternus os

the Dialogue had died (like the other interlocutors) in the interval between
tt.1>.74—75 and the date at which the treatise was composed. A reference

to this (and not to the fate of the other Maternus, the σοφιστῆς) may
perhaps be detected in the end of ch. 13, where the speaker dwells on

the thought of death with an inspired prevision which the writer may have
· wished to indicate had been only too well founded. And many difficulties
as to the general tendency of Maternus’s utterances, and consequently
