MANUSCRIPTS. lxxxvii

,- 35. 21 must be classed as doubtful (prosequantnr X, persequantur Y)
though Ihave adopted what seems to have been the reading of X.

In what may be considered minor matters of orthography, the
advantage is sometimes on theone side, sometimes on the other, e. g. :—

6. 1 iocunditas EV2CA, iucunditas H iocunditates A, iucunditatchB

10. 16 elegorum ECADH, elegorum V² elegiarum AB

26. 23 demeacula HV2CAD,diminuta ΑΕ clt'munuta Β

30. 2 aucton'bus EV2CADH outon'bur AB

15. 16 concentus ABE (for concentu) concentus V2CADH

l‘l. 9 statue ABE statuae V„CAD, statup H

19. a¹ alte AB altae mcor), altg H

32. 22 utquoe ABDH utque Ev2cu

39. 5 tabularia ABDH tolrelarr'oe V2C‚ tabulan'e E,
sabulan'e Δ

39.9 ipsam Aaou psa sucro

Doubtful are 10. 21 where EV,CA give ortes and ABDH ortis3 and
22. 18 where ucpellectile has fully as good MS. authority (nnuma) as the
more correct form supellectili CAD.

In the following doubtful places the true reading is estabHshed by the
agreement of ABEV, as against CuD: H supports the former in the two
first instanceS, the latter in the third 2-

22. 23 fugitet ABEvm fiagiet CD
37. 17 expelatis de expilatis
33.8 ingressura· ingressi DHV, engraessc' CA

The following is doubtful:
17. 28 vocetis ABEV2H vocitetis CAD

The probability here is that the reading oocen's is due to the neglect of
amark of abbreviation: the position is reversed at 22. a 3 where jugulet
(ABEV2A) isright as against fugiet (cb). Cp. 25. 4 where the X family
seems right with constat (ABDH) as against constaret (Ecu). On the
other hand it might of course be argued that the superiority of the aocetclr
tradition points to the unnecessary insertion of a supposed omitted
syllable it in CDA. The latter are often wrong where ABEV, are right
(Scheuer, pp. 23, 24); though the following must be placed to their
credit:-

33. 10 arte et secontia CAD arte et couscientia ABEV2H

37. 11 Metellos et cuDH (so b) Metellos sed et ABEV,

The foregoing lists do not include some striking variatione as regards
