Maternus points the contrast between the forensis oratory of republican
times and that of his own day, we seem to recognize a tone more
eminentlycharacteristie of Tacitus than 01 any contemporary writer: cum in
plerisque indiciis crederet populus Romanus sua interesse quid indicaretur,
39.18.

The 1011110000011011011 on the style 01 the Dentogue by the various
writers 01 whom Tacitus was at the time an enthusiastic student, might be
shown at length, and has‚in fact, been proved by editors in almost excessive
detail Reference has already been made to 010010, with whose works,
especially the rhetorical treatises‚ he was obviously well-acquainted. Even
in his choice 01 the literary form 01 his treatise, Tacitus was no doubt
influenced by Cicero's successful imitationis 01 the Platonic dialogues;
and the commentary on the text will give proof 01 'various reminiscences
which he utilized for the ‘setting’ 01 the piece, as well as for the manage-
ment 01 its development. For example, the Dinlogue professes to be onlya
narrative 01 0 conversation in which certain distinguished persons had once
taken partibus reproducing the frame-work 01 the De Oratore ¹. Tacitus
himself was present only as a listener, like Cicero in the De Amicitia and
De Natura Deorum. The device 01 marking the transition from the first
to the second part of the dialogue by the introduction of a fresh speaker

(ch. 14) seems to be horrowed from the De Oratore ii. § 14: cp. De Rep.
i. 1 17 ². The promise in the last chapter of a continuation of the debate
at soine future time is a feature which Cicero had originally taken from
Plato (see De Orat. i. ad fin.; DeNat. Deor. iii. § 94). Other resemblances
are noticed in connexion with postero die, 2. 1 and Pro duobus promitto,
16. 8. References are made to Cicero's letters (18. aa sqq.) and speeches³‚
his lost dialogue Hortensins (16. 28) and also to his poems (21. 29). Aper
