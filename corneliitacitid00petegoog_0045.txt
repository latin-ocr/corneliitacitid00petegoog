xxxii ’ INTRODUCTION.

have forced itself on the notice of all interested observem, as of great
moment not only in itself, but also in relation to the causes which had
brought it about. In the new condition of things introduced by the
establishment of the e‘mpire, eloquence had little room left it for exercise
and development. Its sphere had become narrowed and confined. The
forum was no longer the political centre of gravity. Debarred from
questions of importance‚ such as had afforded free scope for the oratory
of former days, the art of rhetoric now hid her diminished head in the
inferior law-courts, and in the unreal atmosphere of the schools of
declamation. Empty superficiality and mechanical routine usurped the
place of the power that had formerly swayed the hearts of men: atquae
olim omnium artium domina pulcherrimo comitatu pectora implebat, nunc
circumcisa et amputata, rene apparatu, sim bonore, poene deuermr sim
ingenuitate, quasi uno ex sordidissimis artificiis discatur (3219). No .
discussion of the causes of this decline could fail to take note of the
change in the public taste, of the altered conditions of education at
Rome, of the new political circumstances: and these are some of the
topics treated in the Dialogue.

As to the construction and plan of the work, the main difficulty hinges .
⁸ on the great lacuna which occurs at the close of the thirty-fifth chapter,
and the distribution of parts in what follows. This must affect our
estimate of the part played in the debate (r) by Secundus, and (a) by
Maternus. There is less doubt about Messalla, and none at all about
Aper. Aper's attitude may be plainly enough inferred from the account
already given of the contents of the treatise. He is a realist and a utili-
tarian ¹, who has made his way by hard work at the bar, and who knows
both the value of the position he has achieved and the best methods of
securing it ². He speaks with the strong professional feeling of a man
