THE INTERLOCUTORS AND THEIR PARTS. xli

Itis the, seeming inconsistency between Maternus as the champion
ofa sort of republican freedom in the first part of the Dialogue, and
Maternus as the eulogist of the imperial government, that has given
rise to the various suggestions for a different distribution of parts in
the closing chapters of the treatise. Many think that Messalla, not
Maternus, is the speaker who resumes in ch. 36, and still more argue
for Secundus. Neither view is possible without the assumption of
additional lacunae for which there is no manuscript evidence. Steiner
and Weinkauff have thought that chs. 36-41 ought to be assigned
to Secundus, and that the speech referred to in the words Finierat
Maternus (ch. 42) must have been lost after the end of 41 ¹. Others,
following Heumann, have invented a lacuna at 40. 6, before the words
Nan de olrbsa et qarita re loquamur, attributing what follows to Maternus,
while what goes before is assigned either to Messalla or to Secundus.

As to Messalla, it is very improbable that, except at the close, he
’ speaks again in the Daalogue after the great lacuna. In it the end of
his speech must have been lost, as well as the beginning of the speech
, ,οἱ the next interlocutor. The theory that in ch. 36 he is still con-
tinuing his description of the conditions under which the orators of
former days were trained seems to be incompatible with what we know
of him as an uncompromising champion of republican institutions The
speech contains too many regrets to have been made by Messalla. That
he did not 'altogether agree with it is indicated in ch. 42. 1, where
he says that there are some points in it which he would have liked to
contradict. And again, the supposition that Messalla is still speaking in
ch. 36 is not consistent with any division of the treatise into proportional
parts. ·

There is more plausibility in the arguments adduced in favour of
Secundus. But the¹ theory that there is a lacuna aftersaces’admouabant
in 40. 6, and that all that is left of Maternus's closing speech begins with
the words Nan de otabsa ct punita re loquimur must at once be rejected.
In the first place there is no manuscript evidence in favour of it, and
when lacunae occur in MSS. it is very seldom that they begin at the end
of one sentence and stop at the commencement of another (cp. chs.
35, 36). Again, though the arrangement seems open to criticism, and
the speaker repeats himself more than once, there is an obvious sequence
of thought in the passage referred to, instead of any break or discon-
tinuity; it is sufficient to quote alongside of Non da alzbsa et quieta re
loquimur the similar utterance at 37. 28 sed, ul sannae admoneo,

¹ The appearanoe of a few dots at the end of ch. liin the Farnesianus (C) is uo
argument in favour of this assumption.
