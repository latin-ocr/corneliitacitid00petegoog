The agreement of the Y class in readings which differ from those of
AB is sufficient to establish the fact, which could also be proved from the
Germania and the Suetonius, that the MSS. cited above as composing it
derive from a different original than that which is reproduced in A and B.
The question which of the two families is worthy of greater eredit will be
discussed at the conclusion of this chapter. Meanwhile their derivation

and mutual relationship may be considered.
Reifferscheid¹ was the first to disprove the generally accepted theory

thath and B were direct copies of Enoch’s codex, while at the head of
the Yfamily stood a third copy, now lost, but closely related to A and B.
He showed that A and B contain certain corruptions and wrong
readings which do not appear in the Y family, and which, from their
peculiar character, must have had their origin in a codex the writer oi
which had been deficient in ability to resolve the compendia in the
original from which it was copied. There is general agreement now that
Α is a direct copy of the lost codex (X) which was transcribed either
immediately from the manuscript found by Enoch, or from the copy

· which Enoch made. Another copy was the codex written by PontanuS,

which is reproduced for us in B. The derivation and relationship of the
⁴ members of the Y family have been the occasion of a greater divergence
oi opinion, and some of the material necessary for a decision has only
lately been supplied by Scheuer in the valuable paper to which reference
has already been made ¹. By a searching comparison of their various
readings Scheuer has demonstrated the incorrectness of the views enter·
tained by his predecessors, Michaelis and Baehrens, in regard to the
manuscripts of the Y family. Michaelis believed that the truest repre-
sentative and nearest lineal descendant of the lost codex Y was to be
found in D, however carelessly copied this manuscript must be admitted
to have been. Alongside of D he placed another direct copy of Y, now
los't, which he supposed was the original of C and Δ, while Ewas believed
to have been copied from C, though corrected from the Vatican A.
