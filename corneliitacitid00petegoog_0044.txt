THE INTERLOCUTORS ΑΝῙ) THEIR PARYS. xxxi

be looked for than might belong to any conversation among friends who
make amore or less casual meeting the opportunity of indulging ina
somewhat formal debate ona given subJect. In spite, however, of the
disclaimer of original treatment which is made in th'e introductory chapter
(ziam numeris iidemque rationibus), no one will be found to contend that
the writer is merely reporting, so far as he could recall them to memory,

the pericchio verda of the several speakers. The main lines were no ’

doubt laid down for him: he adheres to the order of debate (servato
ordine disputationis), and the sentiments expressed by the various indi-
viduals are evidently in accord with the views which they may have put
forward on the occasion referred to, or at least with those which they
were known to have entertained. But the writer is more than a mere
reportet: he is a constructive artist who, with one main purpose in view,
must have set himself to weld together in a harmonicus whole the various
materials on which he had elected to work.

Such deiects, or rather difficulties, of plan and construction as have
been charged against the treatise, are obviously attributable to the incom-
plete and mutilated condition in which it has come down to us. As to
its main motive and purpose, there can be no reasonable doubt It is an
attempt to discover and set forth the reasons why eloquence no longer

flourishes atRome as it did in the days of Cicero. Some have thought
that the proper subject of the Dialogue is the comparative worth of poetry

and eloquence, and the question which of the two branchesaman of genius
and culture ought, in existing political circumstances, to devote himself
to. But this is the subject merely of the introductory part of the piece
(cha 1-14), which serves not only as the ‘setting' of the whole, but also
as a preparation for the note which is sounded in the closing chapters
The causes of the decline of eloquence are not, indeed, directly dealt
with till the twenty-eighth chapter: but the part immediately preceding
(chs. 15-27), in which Aper and Messalla debate the comparative
merits of‘ancient' and ‘modern’ eloquence, is necessary to the com·
position of the whole and quite in place as leading up to the main subject
of the treatise. In spite of the aberrations of some editors, nothing can
be plainer than the fact that it is the reason of the decay of oratory that
is the chief topic of discussion ¹. That was a phenomenon which must
