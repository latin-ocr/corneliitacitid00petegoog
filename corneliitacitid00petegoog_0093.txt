The remarkable agreement of H with the early printed editions may
be made the subject of a separate paragraph, as showing the influence
which the copyist exerted on the early constitution ol the text. H has

been shown to be of earlier date than 1470, the year in which the odotoh
proncps appeared; if it was conveycd to England some eight or nine
years previously, it may have been used, before being sent off, to com· ’
plete, as regards the Dialogus, some manuscript of the family to which
the Vindobononn's (V) belongs, and from which Spira is believed to have

printed his text. The following are instances ol mistakes in H, generally
shared by V, and, perpetuated in the early editions; omissione are indi-

are due to misinterpretation of compendia :-
