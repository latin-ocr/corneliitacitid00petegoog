one of those impacticable philosophers against whom even the patient
Vespasian had to act with vigour¹. Like Tacitus, he had his regrets for
the past, but he did not rebel against the present. He recognizes, with
Messalla, the superiority of the eloquence of the ‘antiqui' (27. 3), buthe
tempere Messalla's rather one-sided exaltation of the oratory of repub-
lican times by dwelling on the regrettable conditions on which it had
thriven. His whole attitude is one of reconciliation. He can venture
to be severe on persons of such doubtful antecedents as Crispus and
Marcellus (13. ιι), and he claims for himself the same freedom of speech
as he would allow to others (27.12): buthe is sensible also of the
advantages which settled order and good govemment have secured for
the state (38 ad fin), even though the introduction of the new
regime had not at once involved the downfall of those who, like Crispus
and Marcellus, had made themselves indispensable to former and more
unworthy rulers. His frequent references to the contracted sphere in
which oratory was now confined are made as an additional justification
of his persona} attitude. He is forsaking a profession which had become
irksome to him² (remotum . . . necessetate cotidie ale'qut'd contra animum

have supposed. The attitude of Maternus towards imperialism must

Tacitus himself ³. The chief person of the Dzblogue gives utterance to
