THE QUESTION OF AUTHORSHIP AND DAYE'. xix

partly due to some expression of disapproval that had been conveyed to
him. The tone of Maternus’s reference to some of the court favourites
(13. 10) may very well have been a ground of offense. Eprius Mar·

cellus waS, indeed, dead and gone, and cannot have held a high place in
the emperor’s memorics of the past: Domitian may not have loved his
father, but it is impossible that he can have had any liking for conspirators ¹.
Vibius Crispus, on the other hand, continued to flourish at the imperial
court till his death at an advanced old age, in the year nn. 93. But even
under Titus such persons as Crispus, who worked their way to power by
the methods of the delator, had begun to be in less request (Suet. Tit. 8).
Itis just as likely that any displeasure which the emperor may have
expressed was occasioned by the general complexion of the work as by
any particular utterance. And after all such displeasure cannot have
been very deeply felt. The writer had not been guilty of any disparagr'ng
allusions to Domitian himself or to the circumstances of his reign, and
his political theories must have been shared by many in the Rome of
that day. Witbout some reference to them, and some discussion of their
ments, the schools of rhetoric, in which he had been trained, would have
failed for want of material.

While admitting that there is nothing improbable in the theory that
the author may have received some indication of imperial displeasure²‚
Icannot agree with Wolff in identifying Tacitus with the unknown writer
referred to by Quintilian in his enumeration of the historians of Rome (x. 1,
104). Suchawork as the Dialogus de Oratoribus cannot have given Tacitus
any claim to a place in that catalogue, and we do not know what progress
he had made with the preliminary task of collecting material for his his-
torical writings hythe time when Quintilian published the Institutio (about
95 A.n.), in which the first chapter of the Tenth Book is incorporated prob·
ably as an abstract of the substance of much previous teaching. We shall
find that it is highly probable that it was the influence ol Quintilian which
directed Tacitus, along with Fabius Justus and others, to the investigation
of such problems as that set forth in the Dialogue, for the treatment of
which their youthful intellects might otherwise have been immature. But
Quintilian was worldly enough to know when to assume a courtly tone ⁸,
and he would hardly have pronounced the eulogy referred to, if its
unknown subject had incurred tlre emperor's marked displeasure.
