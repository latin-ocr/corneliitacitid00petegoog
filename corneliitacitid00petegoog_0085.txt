de airis illustribus, and (a) the Agricola, (b) the Dialogne, and (c) the
Germania, irc. Ἰ ,

The Ottobomanns (Ε) is a late codex (fifteenth or sixteenth century)
with very miscellaneous contento. After Messalae Corvini a'e prognm'e sna
libellas comes (a) the Suetonius fragment, and (d) the Dialogne, followed ’
by many tractates, too various to mention. The importance of 'this Ἴ
codex was first recognized by Michaelis, but it was taken for a copy of
the Farnesranns (C) corrected from A. This theory was disproved by
Steuding, who erred, however, in attributing CE and Δ to a common
source.

Next to E may be placed the nnoooomnet nccxr (V), whose hinship
with the ottobonianus has been clearly demonstrated by Scheuer, and
whose contento are equally miscellaneous. At the close of the series
comes (a) the Germania, followed by (b) the Dialogne, and (c) the
Suetonius This codex bears date nn. 1466. It has been designated V,
to distinguish it from another Vienna manuscript, via.-

Vindobonensis cccnr (V). This codex bears the arms of Matthias
Corvinus, King of Hungary, for whom it was probably written. It after·
wards belonged to Joannes Sambucus (1563). It contains the last six
books of the Annali, the Historias, and (a) the Germania, (b) the
Dialogne, where the addition to the title, in a later hand, of the name
of Quintilian helped to forward the theory tha me Dialogne was really
the composition of the great teacher of rhetoric. For tbe historical.
books, it is in close agreement with the codex from which Spira must
have printed his edztr'o princeps: see Wissowa‚ Lectiones Tacitr'nae, Speci-
men Tertium, 1832. So far as the Dialogne is concerned, it was
“ probably copied, carelessly enough, from a codex closely related to the
Harleianns (H), the account of which may be postponed to p. lxxv².

The divergeuce between the two families will be made evident bya
consideration of the following places :—
