xx INTRODUCTION.

With the theory that the Dt'alogm was written by Tacitus when about
thirty years of age, and that the conversation at which he professes to have
been present toolr place some ten years previously, the internal evidence
offered by the treatise harmonizes very well. We shall find that the
style is as Ciceronian as was possible for a writer living towards the end
of the first century: anatural phenomenon iu the case of one who had
begun his career as an orator ¹, and who was embodying in this treatsie
the fruits of his early rhetorical and literary studies. The later style of
Tacitus is very different, but it would have been out of place in such
a work as this, even if we could suppose that he had already developed it
at the time when the Dzizlogue appears to have been written. Then he
no doubt shared in that reaction against Seneca of which Quintilian
made himself the chief exponent—some of the features of the philo·
sopher's style and mode of thought being exemplified in the person of
Aper, for criticism by others with whom Tacitus had more literary and

personal sympathy: afterwards the bitter experience of public affairs at ’

Rome and the iron pressure ofa cruel despotism led him to adopt,
in dealing with altogether different subject matter, the concentrated
vigour of the terse, pithy, and pointed style for which his name now
stands as a synonym. Those who question his authorship of the
Dtirlogm, on the ground of difference of style, base their case on reasons
which would lead them also, as Mr. Simcox sayS, to ‘doubt the genuine·
ness of Mr. Carlyle’s early essays in the Edmburgh Rmr'ew if he had not
collected them himself? While Cicero is undoubtedly Tacitus's model
in the Drhlogue‚ the treatise contains clear traces of the writer’s own
individuality, besides unmistalreable coincidences, as regards words and
phrases, with the usage of the historical books ². There isa considerable
correspondence also between the criticisms pronounced on Roman
orators and others in the Dialogue, and what Tacitus says about the
’ same individuals elsewhere: this will be brought out in the notes (eg.
on 5. 32)³. The eulogy of republican eloquence and of the orators of
old, in ch. 36, may be compared with the speech put into the mouth
of C. Silius when advocating the enforcement of the lex Cz'nm'a (Anu.
xi. 6): and one of his sentences (pulcherrimam ahoquin et bonarum
arizium principem sordzilzlr mmzitert'rlr foedam) reminds the reader of
another famous passage in the Dialogue (32. 18) ut quae olim omnium
