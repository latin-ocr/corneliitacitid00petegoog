On the other hand, 1112 following differences may be noted, caused by

The following are interesting examples 01 those transpositions (reproe

For the rest, it is noticeable that H, while' 111 general agreement with
the Y family, shares with Da leaning 10 ΑΒ ,especially the former. In

tabulated may suggest 10 101112 2 theory that there may have been inore
