.lvi INTRODUCTION.

47, 13 enre'gnc'tior iii. 70, 10; metuentior xiii. 25, 15, and many other
instances. Among more or less peculiar uses of adjectives may be
noted secundus 33. 5 (secundcisima eorum studea: cp. Quintilian's phrase
studz'arunc fructus x. 3, 2; xii. 6, 33 11, 4); beatus 9.19; allus 14.3
(ultim sermo, i.e. graacbr sarno: cp. Quintili. 8, 4² altrat quaestcal: also ,

the personal construction with manfistus 16. 11. The peculiar use of the ’

future participle may also be mentioned here: see on mansurum 9. 22.

Α2 to Pronouns, the use of hic with reference to contemporary
circumstances is characteristic both of Tacitus and Quintilian :. see on
28. 9; 32. 13, and cp. 37. 6 ; Germ. iii. 3, xx. 1. Instances of et epse
occur 30. 1 and 37. 15.

ln regard to Verba, it is well known that Tacitus shows a growing
tendency to prefer simple forms to their corresponding compounds
Here are a lew examples. Adsuescere occurs Dc'al. 20. 9; 34.6; Agr.

xvi. 19 ; xxi. 3; Germ. iv. 8: erescere, Aren. ii. 44, 2 ; 52. 4 ; xiv. 27, 8. J

Adcieeare, Dr'al. 16. 7 ; Agr. xxi. 4: annone, Ηίεί. v. 23, 53 Ann. ii. 78, -
9. Innotesccre, Dc'al. 10. 53 He'st iv. 50, 2, whereas notescere is the form
used in the Annals. Demonstrarc occurs four times in the Dablogae,
e.g.7. 17: in the Agricola and Germania the simple form is found as
frequently. The author's preference, in the Dealogae, for compound
forms is made an argument lor the retention of depacaoerat 38 ad fin,
where see note. Cp. the frequent use in the Annals of paratas for
apparatus (Dial. 22. 21). On the other hand we have in the Dialogue
flexisse 19. 45 finire (lor definere) 38. 6 ; cludere 30. 26 ; pensare 40 ad
fin. ; vanescere 10. 25; serre (for efferre) 19. 17; fialerc' 17. 173 32. 9:
cp. also 25. 9: while a lew cases are doubtful, as sequetur-enseqm'tur 10. 3,
and perhaps hortatur—exhortatur 14. 9.

It is hardly necessary to illustrate the development ο1 the usage by
which compound verbs take a simple accusative instea'd of a prepositional
construction: cp. however antecedere 25. 153 praecurrere 25. 5, and see
Draeger§ 40.

The frequent use of the perfect subjunctive, in modest assertions, is
also to be noted, eg. tenuerim 13. 2; cesserit 13. 103 dc'xerr'rn 32. aa;
vocaverim 18. 4 ; nan negaverim 26. 14 3 Draeger § 28. So even ut sic
dexerim 34. 8 ; 40. 19.

Among other peculiarities may be mentioned a certain preference for
the plural verb even in cases where it is used with two antithetical
nominatives, e. g. 42. 6 Ego depactas, Messalla autem antc'qnarr‘is crimene-
br'neur. In other writers, the verb naturally follows the number of the
second nominative. Cp. He'st. ii. 30,14 Caecina ut sardan ac macn-
· losum, ille ut tumeiiam ac oanan enreilebant: so censuere, Ann. i. 8, 143
