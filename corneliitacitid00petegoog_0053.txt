ference for poetry by the contentiori that forensia oratory, even in its
most perfect type, is nothing but an inferior development, due to the
loss of primitive innocence‚ of the form in which eloquence dwelt with
men in the golden age, viz. poetry: baec eloquentiae primordia, baec
penetralia ,· boc primum babitu cultuque commoda mortalibus in illa casta
ct nullis contacta veliis pectora influxit,· sic oracula loquebantur, 12. 6.
In the latter his retirement from the profession of an, advocate is
explained by reference to the narrower limits within which eloquence
now moves, as compared with the days of old. In both his speeches,
Maternus sighs for quiet retirement: compare such expressions as
inquieta et anxia oratorum urta, with its certamina and pericula, and the
insanum ct lubricum forum, in the first, with the repeated statement in
the second, non de otiosa et quieta re loquimur et quae probitate et maasiae.
