lxxxviii INTRODUCTION.

the use ofpronouns (1111.. . 1111, lrz’c. . ,11) which distinguish the two
families of MSS. Scheuer (after Binde) has reckoned that both agree
thirty-one times in showing ille, and ten times in r'stc.; there remain
twenty places where X gives a'ste and Y 213¹. Michaelis generally adhered,
in his critical edition, to AB and iste, but was forced to accept illa at

30. ar (where the pronoun is thrice repeated, per anaphoram), while at
37 he takes ipsos from E, with all editors. Binde, who gives an
exhaustive treatment of the subject in the second chapter of his disserta·

. tion, thought that in the Y class ista had been deleted ‘ubi nudum, ubi

ante suum nornen, uhi post primum adiectivum, si substantivo apponuntur
duo adiectiva, positum erat’3 but Scheuer rightly doubts how a'copyist
could have arrived at such a ‘law,’ and quotes against it the instances at
23 7; 41. 203 26. 6 (where there is a general agreement for iste in the

Itu seems certain that ΑΒ cannot be invariably right twhile on the other
hand theY class cannot be followed m all cases. Α11 editors agree in
altering 1111 (the reading of all the 1111111 illa at 41. 1ο ; on the other
hand there is no dubiety about librum titum 3. 63 tragoediae 111113. 153
comatulus istos 11. 13. As in other textual difficulties, an eclectic method
must be pursued in deciding between X and Y where they disagree3 for

instance, I accept isto from AB at 19. 4, and, with equal probability3

istos at 10. 23, butreject it at 12. 16. Other passages for comparison
are 13. 33 13193 21. 28; 24. 123 and 25. 5 where theY class
gives illos and the X class istos3 12. 203 13. 13 16. 5; 18. 7, · 23.2;
and 33 22 where Y=ill ll,ud and X=zitud3 9 203 12. 8, 13. 19, '

and 2313 where Y=ill llam and X=tbtam3 19 9 where Y=il llaand X:
1111.

Α similar difficulty arises (as frequently in other MSS) about the use
of iis and 1111. Examples are: hir most codd, iis B, 30. 16 z'ir AB, his
EV,CAH‚ bris D (as again at ll. 6); 34. 34 iis ABCAH, ais EV„ Is D
¹ (cp. 31.’4); 42. 5 iis ΑΒΕ, aisEV,DH; 14. 18 z'r'r ABCAD, his EV,H;
24. 8 11111011), 11111111 cp. 25. 9 iisdem ABCADH, haidem EV,;
35. 13 fn's ABEV,D, iis CA ; 37. 9 artABEv,DH, iis CA. The prefer·¹
enee of C for iis may be noted in the last two places: cp35. 2 iis CAD,

111111111.1111ο11),11111[1ἑ1]11,11 11. 1111111111

¹There can be little doubt that this bility of misinterpretation rs evident from
must be due to the similarity of eom· the occurrence (Dial. 1417) of' eam in
pendia. 1t1s remarkable, as Binde has CADfora'llaEV2H, astaAB: rrrywhile
pointe ed out, that AB never give iste at all
iu the Suetonius fragment, and only once at 19. 4 D actually shows 1 aior illa Y,
in the Germania (x. 17): but the proba· ista X.
