xxxviii INTRODUCTION.

as to the whole purpose of the Dielegue, are removed, or at least lessened,
by the theory that Tacitus followed Cicero’s example in not introducing
Α living personages. However this may be, Maternus is undoubtedly the
protagonist of the plece. It is through him that Tacitus gives expression
to his own thoughts. The future historiari saw that his work, too,

would be done, not in the bustle and racket of the forum, but inquiet
retirement. His regret for the old free-state was tempered, like that ol

Maternus, bya practical acquiescence in the necessity for the empire.
It is his voice we seem to hear when the poet-pleader expresses his
preference for Vergil's life of repose (malo securum et quietum Vergilii
secessum, 13. 4), and when, at the end of the debate, he points out that
every age has its own advantages (nune quonium nemo eodem tempore
adsequi potest magnam famam et magnam quietem, bono saeculi sui quisque
citro obtrectationem alteriies utatur, ch. 41 ad fin). It is, in fact, bytho
closing speech that the so-called ‘republicanism' of Maternus is reconciled
and harmonized with existing political conditions.

Other theories ol this closing speech have been put forward by editors,
and remain to be considered. In this edition it is attributed to Maternus,
not only on the evidence of the manuscripts, but on other grounds as
well. lt is in it that we find the sullest expression of that spiritual
sympathy between speaker and writer which was evidently Tacitus's
motive in making Maternus the main personage of the piece. He is,
as has been said, the protagonist, with whom the discussion begins and
with whom it ends. lt has not been noted by any commentator that
the true explanation of the placid manner in which, in the introduction,
Maternus meets the hasty criticisms which are being advanced against
his ‘Cato‚' is to be found in his consciousness of his own position. In
the first place, these criticisms are nothing but the outcome of popular
gossip3 fabulae malrgnorum as they are styled even hythe cautious
Secundus¹ (3. 4). Aper does not seem to attach much welght to his
friend's alleged indiscretion3 to him it is simply an ‘outburst of his
noble soul' (effervescit vis pulcherrimae naturae tuae), all the more dis-
interested because it was connected with the name of one so far removed
from present-day controversies ( preliator et nostri soeculi controuersias)
as Cato. Aper would not shrink from a similar indiscretion himself in
defence ol a friend: siquando necesse sitpro periclitante amieo potentiorum
aures offendere, et probata sit fides et libertas excusata, 10 ad fin. As for
Maternus himself, he has no fears on his own account, no apprehension
that any action will be taken against him. His innocence hes hitherto
