ῙΗΕ QUESTION OF AUTHORSHIP AND DATE. vii

nence to Gutmann's argument, Orelli himself declared his preference for
the tradition of the Tacitean authorship. To him the Dralogue was
a work of the historian’s youth, written while he was still under the
influence of the associations of the schools of rhetoric, and before he had
passed from the stage of enthusiastic adherence to Cicero, as the perfect
model of Latin eloquence, to the development of the highly individual
style which characterizes the Historias, and still more the Annal .
The absurdity involved in applying the same standard of criticism to
a dramatic dialogue and a narrative of events he protests against in the
following words: Altam orationem exigit narratur rerunt, alzone deincep-
tatr'o quaestionis alr'cue'u's. Boni scrzpterzi est utrumque genus intellectu
dritznguere, alterutro uti, excellentis vero parent esse r'n utriusque oratzimis
facultate. Atqui ega Tacitum excellentem dr'cendr' artificem exr'stz'rna tarn υἱ
naturae quarn arte doctrinaque. Quid rnr‘rune egitur si tn driszinrllimo
genere de'cendr' sibi ἐρεῖ clr'ssr'rnrllirnussuitr

If the current of opinion since Orelli’s day had set in the same
direction‚ the history of the controversy might now be considered closed.
But though scholars like Doederlein and Niebuhr sided with the vindicators
of Tacitus, nothing better than an open verdict was arrived at by Eckstein‚
when he undertook to review all the conditions of the problem as well as
the opinions which had previously been pronounced on either side ¹.
While fully appreciating the force of the various arguments which had
been adduced in favour of Tacitus, and without attempting to disprove
the tradition of his authorship on any such grounds as inferiority of
subiect matter or discrepancy of dates Eckstein concluded that the
disparity of style was so great (ab difficultatem tn dz'cendr'genere a Taciti
plane abhorrente positam) that more light must be waited for before any
final deliverance could be arrived at ². For a time negative criticism was
again in the ascendant. Eckstein was followed by H. C. Α. Eichstadm
whose views may be found summarized in Orelli's second edition
(1848), vol. ii, p. 523. He believed that the treatise was composed
during the reign of Domitian (though it may not have seen the
light till the time of Nerva or Trajan) by one who was well read in
contemporary literature, as well as in the works of Cicero. In general,
the style is held to resemble that of Quintilian, though it is admitted that

Spalding had effectually disposed of the theory that Quintilian was the
