MANUSCRIPTS. lxiii

probability is that we owe the minor works, not to Poggio, but to a Pope
who was also an earnest scholar, and practically the founder of the
Vatican Library at Romo Iu the year 1451, Nicholas V had sent the
mouk Enoch of Ascoli, formerly one of his most intimate associates,
into France, Germany, and Denmark, to search for manuscripts aud to
take copies. There is still extant a letter in which he recommends his
emissary to the good offices of Ludwig of Erlichshausen. After referring
to his intention of making a collection of Greek and Latin MSS, worthy
os the Supreme Pontiff and the Apostolic See, Pope Nicholas specifies
the motive of Enoeh's mission in the following passage: sed nem multi
libri ex antiquesdeficiant, qui cupa superiorum temporum sunt deperditi, ad
inquirendum et transcribendum si repertantur eiusmodi libros malumus
dibctum filcicm Enoch Eseulannm orrum doctum grecc's et hunis litteris,
familiarem nostrum, quidioersa loca et monasteria inquirat, siquis ex ipsis
deperditis apud vos libris reperiretur. Idcirco nostri contemplatione uelis
omnes tui territorii libros sibi ostendere, antz‘quos presertim et prisce scrip·
ture, et se'rnul permittere ut in tuo territorio scribi possit expensis nostris.
Nolumus enim ut aliquis liber surripiatur, sed tantummodo ut fiat copia
transcribendi super quibus ipse Enoch tecum loquetur lateus ex parte
nostra ¹.

At first, Enoch does not seem to have fulfifled the high expectations
that had been formed of the prospects of his mission. Poggio, in
particular, appears to have had a poor idea of his qualifications. Enoch
had been a pupil of Filelfo, with whom Poggio had interchanged such
courtesies as were common among the scholars of that day ; and he was
undertaking a task in which Poggio himself had already been more than
once disappointed, notably in an effort to procure a complete copy of
Livy which he had been told was to be found in a Cistercian monastery
near Ltibeck. in a letter addressed to Fr. Coppino, Poggio says that, in
two years, Enoch had found nothing that even an uneducated person
would findit worth his while to read ². Porphyrio’s commentary on
Horace and Apicius seem to have been the chief results ot Enoeh's early
efforts. But the air was full of the rumour ot new discoveries. The
times were favourable, and such a mission as Enoeh's was not likely to
provea failure in the end. We know from Poggio's letters to Niccolo
Niccoli³ (1425-28) that he had himself formerly been on the track of some
