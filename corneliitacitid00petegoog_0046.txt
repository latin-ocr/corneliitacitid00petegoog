THE INTERLOCUTORS AND THEIR PART S. xxxiii

who is conscious of what he owes to his art. He had come up to Rome
from a Gauiisb province as a novus homa, and had risen by the force of
his eloquence to high office. The approval of his audience, the gratitudo
ol clients, the favour of the great, are to him the things chiefly worth
striving tor: why a man who could command all these should elect to be
apoet rather than an orator passes his comprehension. As a stylist, he
is the representative of the tendencies of which Quintilian expresses
his disapproval. There is a certain. striving aster effect, which seems to
indicate an exaltation of form over substance3 and in the ‘nominis contro·
versia' with which he introduces his disparagement of the ‘antiqui’(16‚ 17)
we recognize the sophistic habitos debate, by which he might have stolen
a march upon a more unwary audience. Aper is all sor piqnancy and
point: colores sententiarum, lumina orationis, nitor et cultus descriptionum,
—these were evidently as much to him as they were to Seneca himself.
Even Cicero he appraises by this standard, and finds him just tolerable.
It was in his more mature years that Cicero, according to Aper, began
to discover what true style really was: lacos quoque laetiores attemptanti
et quasdam sententias rnaenr't, utique in iis orationibus quas senior eam
et iuxta finem oz'tae composuit, id est, postquam usuque et experimentis
drite'cerat quod eptimam dicendi genus esset, 22. 7. His earlier speeches
are not free from the laults ofa former age: heis slow and tedious‚
wanting in passion, and destitute ol what Aper and his friends valued
most, showy passages, epigrams, and ‘quotable bits’: pauci sensus apte
et eum quodam lumine terminantur: nillil excerpere, nihil referre possis, et
oelut in rudi artifieiofirmus sane paries et duraturus sed non satis expolitus
et splendens, l.c. His own position he defines in a well-known sentence which
occurs in the same context: ego autem oratorem, sicutlocupletem ae lautum
patrem familiae, nan ea tantum oola tecta tegi quod imbrem ac oentum arceat,
sed etam quod orsum et oculos delectet, nan ea solum instrui supellectile qnae
necessariis melus sufficiat, sedasse in apparatu er'us et aurum et gemmas, ut
sumere in manus et aspicere saepius libeat. It is somewhat surprising that
so eminent a representative of contemporary tendencies as Aper evidently
was should nowhere be even alluded to by Quintilian. We may infer
that, if he was still alive when Tacitus wrote, he had at least withdrawn
from practice at the bar (aptum... contemnebat... nesciebat, ch. 2),
and that he died without leaving behind him anything fit to enter into the

prevailing taste no longer required an what was prized by the adherents of the
orator to give proof of possessing that new school, and it was with the idea of
wide culture that was the hoast oi the gaining increased prestige in regard to it
Ciceronian era (32. 10: cp. 19 δίῃ) that he affected to look down on learning
His main interest was in the formal and and culture (e. g. philosophy 31. ²5) as
technical aspectos his art. That was ‘extraneous accomplrsbments.‘
