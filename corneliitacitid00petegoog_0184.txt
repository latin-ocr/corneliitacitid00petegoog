DJAEOGUS DE ORATORIBUS. 79

pamm laboratur : necin auctoribus cognoscendis nec in evolvenda
antiquitate nec in notitia vel rerum vel hominum vel temporum
satis operae insumitur. Sed expetuntur quos rhetoras vocant;

most frequently iu the nominativec cp.
37. 15 below, quae et ipsa plurimum
eloquentiae praestant, and for other iu-
stances see Gerber and Greci, s. v. et,
pp. 399, 400. The ablativa is found
‘Hist i. 41, 1 Titum iude Vinium invasere:
dequo et ipso ambigitur, &c In Livy,
et ipse is frequently used, like ipsc quaque,
as=mi αὐτ s. No conclusive instance
can be cited from Cicero: see on Quiu-
tilianx. 1, 31.

a. nec in, &a After the ‘prima
elementa‚’ the education of a Roman
youth was continued in ⁴ grammatice ' or
‘litteratura’ (Quint. ii. 1, 4): and Mes·
salla's complaint is that both these stages
were now prematurely displaced hy a
barren and unreal training in the technical
mles of rhetoric

auctoribus = scriptoribus. In the
Ciceronian age, auctor carried with it the
idea of ‘authority’ ‘warrauty‚' or the
like: see on Quint. x 1, 24. For
‘cognoscere auctores,' cp. Quint. x. 5, 8.

evolvenda antiquitate. Cic. de Or.
i. §18 tenenda praeterea est omnis anti-
quitas exemplorumque vis. While the
reading and explanation oi great writers,
'especially poeta, was the most important
iunction oi the ‘grammaticus' (Quint.
i. 4-9), instruction was also given in
history (Cic. de Or. i. 5 187; Quint. i. 1,
14; cp. x. 1, 34 with the notes), as well
as in the elements of science and philo·
sophy,-physics, logie, and ethics (Quint.
i. 4, 4): thus Quintilian says of ‘gram-
matice’ inii. 1, 4 ‘tenuis a fonte ad·
sumptis poetamm historicorumque viribus
pleno iam satis alveo fluit, cum praeter
rationem recte loquendi non pamm alio-
qui copiosam prope omnium maximamm
artium scientiam amplexa sit!

3. rerum, ‘departmentsof knowledge’
(cp. omnium. rerum scientia, below):
hominum, ‘human nature,’ ‘character ἐ
temporum, ‘circumstances’ Concrete
conditions, Messalla means, are not
sufficiently studied: their place is taken
by ‘fictae et nullo modo ad veritatem
accedentes controversiae' (81. 3). That
this is the meaning seems to me to be
evident from a comparison oi the defini·

tion with which the chapter concludes,
where we have again ‘remm,’ ‘tempomrn'
and ‘audientium The necessity for a
knowledge of character (hominum no·
titia: cp. nisi qui cognovit naturam
humanam, 31. 11) and ior a dne apprecia-
tion of the effect which different situations
are likely to produce upon the feelings oi
an audience (¹ temporum notitia '), is
enlarged on in the next chapter: see esp.
‘sive apud infestos sive apud cupidos . . .
dicendum habuerit,' &c, and cp. Cic.
Or. §123 sit temporum personarumque
moderator, nam nec semper nec apud
omnes . . . eodem modo dicendum ar-
bitror—John, however, gives a very
differentinterpretatiou,whichissufficiently
ingenious to merit special notice. He
thinks that, just as ‘antiquitas’ in the
text refers to ‘history and antiquities,’ so
‘res' deuotes physics (including astro·
nomy), as in ‘rerum motus causasque,’ iu
line 11, belowz while by ‘homines' he
understands ethics andpsychology (31. 4),
and by ‘tempora ’a knowledge oi political
theory. The last branch would cor-
respond to Cicero's ‘prudentia iuris
publici,' de Or. i. §t 301, 156, or ‘rerum
civilium cognitio et pmdentia,’ ib. i. ξ 60:
cp. also ib. i. §5 159, 165, 48: iii. §5 72,
76. This would leave only dialectics or
logie without special reference in the
enumeration of the fonctions of the ⁸ gram·
maticus.’

4. insumitur = impenditur. So also
in Quintilian (iii. 4, 5), bnt more usually
with the dative, as Anu. iii. 44, 7 libel·
lis accusatomm insumeret operam, and
ch. 9. 1, above, quibus totam vitam
Matemns insumere optat. It ‚is not
limat. tii it triturati
‘the sphere in which)

sed, aiter a negative clause, ‘No'; cp.
ἀλλά. They spend too little time on
preparatory training: the ‘rhetor' is
prematurely called iu.

quos rhetoras vocant: cp. 85. 1 isto-
mm qui rhetores vocantur. So Crassus in
de Or. i. 5 51 ipsi magistri qni rhetorici
vocantur: iii. §54 horum qui nunc ita
appellantur rhetorum. .
