xxiv INTRODUCTION.

serviceableness (uteletas), the pleasure which it confers (voluptas), and the
prestige (dignatam sama, laus) which it wins for the orator (chs. 5-8),

⁴ witha corresponding depreciation 01 poetry as being altogether barren
and unprofitable in all these respects (chs.9,10). Aper is the realist‚ -

¹ the practical man 01 the Dialogua whose formula in estimating the .
worth of poetry is the familiar Cui bono? (9. 5). In the hour of need,
it is to the pleader, he says, that even poets must have recourse,

, ’ Saleius Bassus has to beg people to be good enough to corne and hear
him give a reading of what he has written with so much expenditure of
time and trouble; and even this costs him money. Eprius Marcellus,
on the other hand, and Vibius Crispus hold 0 glorious place. Their
friendship is a real boon to the emperor, as bringing him something

Δ which it passes the power even of an emperor to give: while Bassus has -
to be thankful if princely favour should enrich him, as it lately did, with
agift of money that only serves to bring his dependence on his patron
into greater relief. Yet Aper is not without an appreciation of poetry,
in its proper place. His quarrel is not with poetry, but with Maternus's
preference for poetry: tecum melli, Materne, res estquod, cum natura te
in eptam arcem eloquentiae serat, errare mauis et summa adepturus in
leuioribus subsistis . . . nuuc te ab auditoriali et ttleatre's in farum et ad
causas et ad uera praelia uoco (ch. 10). In concluding his impeachment, ·
Aper points out that poets of Maternus's temperament do not even enjoy
the advantage 01 quiet security and freedom from offence; more will be ⁸
forgiven to the pleader who is outspoken on behalf 01 0 living friend
and client than to a poet who goes out of his way to extol the virtues
of a dead Cato. Ι

,t ’ The short reply 01 Maternus (chs. 11-13) forms 000 01 the most

”¹ interesting portions of the book. The personal contrast between him

¹1 and Aper is crystallized in two phrases which occur at the opening of

y the eleventh chapter: Aper had spoken aereus, ut solebat, et rutente

t are, Maternus is remissus et subradens. To this picture both characters
remain true throughout the picce. In glowing language, ‘fitter for a poet
than for an orator,’ Maternus eulogizes the poet's life as the ideal to
which he intends henceforward to devote himself. Conscious of his
own blamelessness, he has no fear that he will ever be called upon to
exert his oratorical powers except in the defence of others (pra alterius
discrimine). It is the charrn 01 the poet’s life that has captivated him:
'mid the quiet 01 grove and glade will he live, in the hallowed haunts of
song, far from the ‘madding crowd' of clients and suitors and morning-
callers. And the poet is as famous he contends, as the orator: Homer
does not bow before Demosthenes and Cicero meets with more detraction
