who in the Agricola congratulates his heroon the loving care of a pure
and prudent mother (4, 7), and who in the Germania points the contrast
between savage virtue and civilized corruption in the well-known words

Wn may now endeavour to obtain an idea of the contenta of the
Daalogue, though the attempt to analyze its substance must necessarily
anticipate some of the problems which will require to be dealt with
subsequently. .

The treatise may be taken as consisting of three main parts, to the
first ol which is prefixed an introduction (chs. 1-4) setting forth the

in ch. 27.

ch. 42), or that the speech from ch. 36 to ch. 41 is not acontinuous
whole. But a nearer consideration ol the general scheme of the
