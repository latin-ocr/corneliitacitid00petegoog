l INTRODUCTION, ,

is even allowed (23 ad init.) to raise a laugh over the hackneyed esce
vedeatur as well as over some of Cicero’s inferior witticisms (rotam
Fortunae, e'us Verrinam, ibid). Messalla, on the other hand, quotes him
as a high authority on the necessity of a wide philosophical culture for
the orator (32. 28).

The search for specific resemblances in the De'alague to the language
and phraseology of Cicero is liable to be overdone 1. Little is to be
gained by recording fortuitous coincidences of expression between two
authors, except in cases where the phrases used by both are marked by
something more or less characteristic and striking. In this view, such
expressions as the following may bc noted as being not improbably (see tho
notes) conscious reminiscences of Cicero rather than the ‘current coin'
of the language of Tacitus's own day: datm exemere, 19. 10 ; contro-
uersias tueri, 10. 373 redolent antiquitatem, 21. 18 ; animorum uenas
tenere, 31. 19. Other resemblances will be found duly noted in the
commentary‚ but it may be convenient to give arlsumi of them also
here (cp. Goelzer, p. xxxv, note). Take the first book os the De Oratore
and cp. ξ ao etenimex rerum cognitione efflorescat et redundet oportet
oratio with Dial. 30. ²33 ᾗ 53 meli qui naturas bominum memque omnem
humanitatis . . . penetus perspexerat with 31. 10; §72 artibus'quae sunt
lebera hamiree dignae . . . quibus ipset, si in dicendo nan utemur, tamen
apparet atque exstat utrum semus earum rerum rudes am didicerimus with
32. 4; ξ 3² arma quibus vel tectus epse esse passis uel prouocare improbos
uel te ulcisci lacessatur with 5. 28 ; ξ 31 quid enim est tam admirabile
quam ex infinita multitudinuexistere unum . . ,with 6. 153 ᾗ 116 profiteri
se esse amnibus sileatebus unum ... with the same passage3 §97 uti ei
qui audirent sic afficerentur am'rnis ut eos affici uellet orator with 6. 17 ;
' and finally the definition of orator quoted from De Or. i. 15, 64 in the
notes on 30. 26. Cp. also with 37. 14 His accedebat, &c., De Or. i. § 15
Excitabat eas magnetudo uare'etas multitudoque in ommi genere causarum.
Reminiscences of the Brutus will be found at 30. 13 and 16 ;. 8. ι5;

33. ¹3· But it is in the general fulness of the style of the De'alague
that the influence of Cicero’s writings on its author may best be traced.
Such synonyma as the following (sometimes with a slightly different
‘shade ol meaning) have a distinctly Ciceronian ring about them, and
have in fact been exactly paralleled by Weinkauff and others: anema?
et ingenii, clamore plausuque, diuitiae et open sama et laus, uei et facultas,
memoria et recordatio, modestia ac pudore, operae curaeque.
