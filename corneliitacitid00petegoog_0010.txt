PREFACE

...Q-..-

THIS book may be regarded as a companion volume to the

edition of the Tenth Book oi Quintilian’s Institutio which was
published in the autumn oi 1891. The one has led to the other:
indeed it was while preparing the Quintilian that it occurred to
me to take the Dialogue also in hand. The motive was the
same in both cases-a wish to do something to remove from the
scholarship oi this country the reproach oi neglecting two ol the
most interesting specimens oi Latin literature, or ol relying
ior a knowledge oi them almost entirely on foreign sources.
· The reader to whom the Dialogus de Oratoribus is a new work
will find much in its character, contente, and history to account
ior the extent os space which I have claimed from my indul-
gent publishers for its adequate treatment. Scholars know
that it is brimsul oi problems, though an exhaustive discussion
oi these problems, such as I have endeavoured to give in the
Introduction, has hitherto been conspicuously absent from the
achievements of Latinists at home. For students, again, the
treatise is oi the utmost value, as supplying a field ior the
exercise of many of the qualities-such as sense oi style, literary
j udgment and critical ability-without which a knowledge oi Latin
will often prove only a barren possession. ln this connection,
I may quote the words in which Classen says there will be
general agreement: ‘dass der Dialog in seiuem mdssigen Umfang
ungemein reichen Stoff zu den anziehendsten Discussionen der
verschiedensten Art darbietet3 und dieseEigenschait eben ist es,
die ihn nach meiner Ausicht ganz besonders zur gemeinsamen
Lectiire mit reifern Schulern, die wir zu selbststandigem Nach-
denken und umsichtigem Urtheil anzuleiten wlinschen, geeignet
macht.’
