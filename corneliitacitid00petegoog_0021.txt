author. Who the author was, must remain one of the unsolved problems
of literature: quisnam ex illa aetate conscripserit Dzizlogum, vr'ar poterit
adlz'qurdum perduci. ,

The year 1841 produced no fewer than three editions of the Dialogue,
those of Hess,Tross, and Pabst. The two editors first named do not grapple
with the question of authorship, though their work was of value in other
respects3 but Pabst came forward as an uncompromising champion of
the Tacitean tradition, dwelling not only on correspondences between the
Dialogue and the historical books in regard to the use of words and
’ figures, &c., but also on the tone of regret for bye-gone timeS, and the
lament over the decay of morals which readers of Tacitus at once
recognize as so characteristic of his mental attitude. Seven years later,
the appearance ofa pamphlet by A. Dupre¹ brought Gutmann again into
the field, without eliciting‚ however, anything of weight on the negative
side except a renewal of the contentiori that it would have been
impossible for an author who had written and published the Dialogue
before or during the early part of Domitian’s reign to have lived safely
through the horrors of his administration. Bernhardy, the historiari of
Roman literature, sided with the opposition, arguing that the points of
resemblance between the Dialogus and the other writings of Tacitus were
unimportant when compared with the points of difference‚and that the latter .
proved more than the former ². At this stage of the controversy (1857)
Fr. Weinkauff produced the firstfruits of those exhaustive labours which
entitle him to the credit of having furnished scholars with much of the
material necessary forits settlementi. The divergencies from the later style
of Tacitus he explained by reference to the character of the historian's
early studies, and to ¹the careful imitation of Cicero which both he and his
friend Pliny the Younger seem to have prescribed for themselves3 and
founding not only on the general tone of the treatise but also on
a laborious and detailed examination of its language and style, he
concluded that the Dialogue was a genuine work of Tacitus, composed
probably in the early part of Domitian’s reign. A similar view as to the
date of the composition (though he afterwards departed from it) was also
taken by Nipperdey in his edition of the Annals: looking, however, to
the introduction to the Agricola, from which it might appear that
Tacitus published nothing during Domitian’s reign, he preferred to
believe that the Dialogue was written and given to the world under
