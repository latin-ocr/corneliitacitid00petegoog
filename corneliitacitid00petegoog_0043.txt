found wanting in the moderatiori and sels-restraint that are called for
under existing conditions. It is here that we must look for the recon-
ciliation ol opposing views. Great oratorical fame is inconsistent now
with the settled calm which pervades the state: let u's be thanhful for
the latter without disparaging the conditions under which the former
was attainable: nunc quoniam nemo eadem tempere adsequi potest magnam

and how far it is the product ol the writer's imagination. There can be ,
no doubt, however, that it rests on a certain basis ol fact. The dramatis

meet the charges that have been made against the construction of the
treatise, against its unity of plan and purpose, by taking refuge in the
Α argument that it is simplya narrative, as accurate as the writer’s recollec-
