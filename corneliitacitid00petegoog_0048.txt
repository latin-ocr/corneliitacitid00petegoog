THE INTERLoCUTORS ANB THEIR PARTS. xxxv

have been the more or less recent death of all the interlocutors that
induced Tacitus to bring them together on his canvas.

Julius Secundus was a friend and contemporary of Quintilian, who
refers to him more than once in complimentary terms ¹. From x. 1, 121
we gather that he died prematurely (armatus), possibly about the
year 80 an? One characteristic of his style seems to bave been
a certain want of spontaneity: this is indicated in the allusion made
in ch. 1 to the criticism passed on him byhis detractors (quamuis maligne
plmpus opinarentur nac Secundo promptum esse sermonem et, &c.), as
well as in Quintilian's phrase, eufimiae curae, quoted below. In the
Dralagru, as we have it now, he does not play the part that might have
been expected of him from the prominent way in which he is introduced,
along with Aper, in the second chapter. His prudent reserve and retiring
disposition are shown in his question to Maternus about a ‘safer' edition
(recurrerem) of that poet's ‘Cato,' and in the way in which he deprecates
the proposal that he should act as arbiter between Maternus and Aper
(ch. 4). Some critics have held that he altogether declines this proposal‚
and ask where he makes his award‚ as there is not even a mention of
him in the closing chapter. But it should not be forgotten that it is
only as regards the difference between Maternus and Aper (as to the
comparative worth of poetry and eloquence) that his arbitration is pro·
posed 3 and, though the entrance of Messalla in ch. 14 gives a new turn
to the debate‚ Secundus first summarizes the rival speeches, of which the
introductory part consists, in an impartial deliverance, in which he shows
due appreciation of the terma of Aper on the one hand, and the aratio
of Maternus on the other (14.6). It is more difficult to decide whether
a speech of Secundus may not have been lost in the great lacuna which
follows ch. 35. On the whole, it appears probable that whether or
not Secundus contributed a set speech, expressing his individual attitude,
he at least played a larger part in the debate than would appear from
the text as we have it nov. Τοο much weight need not be attached to
what Maternus says (16. 8), when he undertakes on behalf of Secundus
as well as for himself, to supply what Messalla may omit in his presenta-
tion of the question under discussion. But, a przhrr‘, it seems improbable
that Secundus would have been so prominently introduced along with
Aper in the opening chapter, if his admiring pupil had only intended to
use him for a few appropriate utteranees to mark the development of
