i. r and Dial. 30 sq), the disadvantages of the existing school-training
(i. a and Dz'av'. 35), its moral effects (i. a, 4 and Dial. 35.Δ 5), the place
of rhetoric in education (ii. 1 and Dzizl. 35), the criticism of literature
(cp. Aper's and Messalla's speeches with the corresponding parts of
Quint. x. 1)-all these are subjects in regard to which the two writers
seem to have had much in common. The fact that their verdicts on
others do not always coincide ought, however, tobenoticed as an additional
disproof os the theory, lately revived by Novak, that it was Quintilian
who wrote the Dialogus: for example there is a slight difference in their
estimate of the prooemia of Messalla Corvinus (see on 20. a): Vibius
Crispus is spoken of with more appreciation by Quintilian than by
Tacitus (see on 8. 2), and Saleius Bassus is credited with a higher
degree of poetical perfectiori by the latter than by the former (see
on 5. 6). Cp. too what is said of Lucan, 20. 19.

It would hardly have been possible sor one writing within twenty years
os the death of seneca to avoid showing any signs of the influence of
that versatile writer. In the opposition between the tendencies which
he represented and the simpler and more natural diction recommended
by Quintilian, Tacitus no doubt sided with the latter: but he could not
escape altogether from the effects which the study of the philosopher's
writings produced on the minds of his readers, and against which,
especially in the case of young students, Quintilian so strongly protests
(x. r, 125 sq). When Tacitus was a young man, Seneca was the most
popular of Roman authors: tum autem salus ln‘c fere in manibus adules-
centium suti (l. c). It is mainly in divergences from ordinary phraseo-
logy that resemblances have been noted, and these will be found in the
commentary: they have been collected, again in excessive detail, by
Weinlrauff (pp. cliii sqq.) and Kleiber (pp. 74 sqq). Reference need
only be made here to the frequent recurrence of the opposition between
sensus and sententiae (see on 20. 16 ; 3217), the use of sucipit (16. 32),
shzbm' (19. 21), infinitus (for magnus, 14. 12 and 15. 11), oblectare atram

(10. ra: cp. auam suum oblectat, Sen. Dz'al. i. 5, 4), in eadem valetudinarii),
21. 4, δια, &c ³

Taking now a general review of the language of the Dialogus, we may
state its main peculiarities‚ under various heads, as under :-

The following words are, in the first place, to be noted as occurring
in the Dialogue for the first time (Draeger §249)t lu'strz'analzi29.10;
praeliator 37. 323 planitas 23. 245 scurrilitas 22. 24 ς uniformes ³2. 23
depacare 38 ad fin.

Here is a list of words which, though not peculiar to Tacitus, show.
