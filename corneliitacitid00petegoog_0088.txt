It was an examinationes the neglected Vz'ndobomnrri uccxr (V,) that
led Scheuer to his conclusions. He found that it is nearly alrin to E,
and almost in exact agreement with it where E shows the readings of X
instead of those of its own class Y. Both therefore derive from a common
source, which must have been a truer representative of Y than that to
which CAD are to be traced. The supposition that either codex was
copied from the other is excluded by a list of variants in which each
shows individua! peculiarities of its own. Instead of E having been
corrected from A or B, the opposite is the case. E is sometimes in
agreement with AB, or with B alone, where V, does not follow it, and
we may therefore infer that their original (y¹) had been corrected after V,
was copied from it In this emended state it was probably used by
Pontanus, or by both Pontanus and the copyist of B. Scheuer next
proves the common origin of CAD, which had already been partly
established by Binde ¹. Their source he designatos y¹, and infers that its
disagrcement with ABEV, must be attributed to caprice or carelessness
on the part of the copyist, while the text of the lost archetype Y may be
restored by the agreement of y¹ with A and B. The fact that D often
forsakes its own class to agree with A and B, where its kindred EV, and
CA are in disagrcement‚ Scheuer explains by supposing for D (or rather
forits original, as Baehrens had suggested) what Michaelis had asserted
for E, namely, correction out of the X family. In proof of this the
following places are quoted where D has been ‘contaminated' from X
and Y: 30. 2 vocantis D, uocatis X, vocantY3 41. 3 quis enain quidem
quod nemo D, quidem quod nemo A, quis em'm Y; ³7. 19 est habendus D,
habendus est X, habendus Y.

Some of Scheuer's conclusions rest no doubt on a superstructure of
hypothesis, but his general theory marks an advance on the work of pre-
vious critics. 1t seems to me, however, that future speculation asto the
inter-relationship of the various codices will have to take account of the
hitherto neglected Harlezirnus, which is certainly of great importance for
the history of the constitution of the text. Inow proceed to report the
result of my examination of this interesting manuscript. Its official
description is as follows: Brit. Mus. Harley 2639, vellum; 8 ><5{ inches 3
ff. 43, fifteenth century. Contains ‘Suetonii tranquilli de grammaticis et
rhetoribus libri duo,’ ff. 2-14 v. : ‘C. Cornelii Taciti Dialogus de Oratori-
bus claris: ff. 15-42 v. On the first folio the name of its last owner is
written ‘Ambrosii Bonvici, 1687! This was Ambrose Bonvicke (1652-
1722), scholar of St. Jolm’s College, Oxford, in 1669, Librarian in 1670,
