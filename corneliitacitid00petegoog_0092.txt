MANUSCRIPYS. lxxix

Harlubuus-the occurrence at the end of the Suetonius of a remarkable
note, in the hand of rba copyist, Hic antiquissimum exemplar finit et hoc
integrum araur. Taken along with indications which go to show that
the original of H must have been a MS. abounding in contractions, this
must be held to render it probable that it was no mere copy that Enoch
brought back with him to Italy, but his original ‘find-the Hersfeld
codex-probably of the thirteenth century. lf this inference is correct,
a lineal descent may be established for H from the archetype of Fulda

Perhaps the most striking internal characteristic of H is its frequent
agreement with the hand in the Ladensis known as b (see p. lxx). If b
is as late as is generally supposed, the probability is that its readings were
derived from H, or from some similar copy executed about the same
time. For‘proof of this agreement, reference might be made to the
critical notes, but it may be instructive to exhibit here some of the
resemblances referred to, as well as some of the differences between
the two traditions.

The following examples in which H and b agree are probably in
many cases the result of an independent attempt on the partos the
copyist of H to resolve the compendia in his original. The oldest editions
(Spirensis and Puteolanus) generally present the same readings :-

5. 12 solicite for soca'etate3 5.15 nationes for necessitudinem 5. a 5 praesidio
for profugn'o; 5. 26 irrepat for increpuit3 6. 18 quacunque for quemcum-
que3 7. 10 in codicillis for codicillis; 8. 7 ipsa eloquentia om. H, del. b;
12. 14 ne aut illud clamare for nec ullis aut gloria maiar; 25. 8si qua minus
for in qua m'rnirum (i); 31. 31 cz'vitatem for comitem (?); 33. 24 circa ora-
toriam ⁸(or -um) for esse aratorum.

otber resemblances between H and b are :-

5.11 arbr'trium3 5. 12 sedet apsum3 6. 18 induxerit3 10. 33 rightly linc
(so Put.); 10. 34 wrongly linc (for laec) ; 21. 3 Canuti3 21. 28 quia; 23. 7
isti orn. H, del. bC ; 29. 4 et uirz'des om. H Put, del. b; inuenies 29. 12.

On the other hand, H and b differ in the following places :—

'l. 17 vetat H (Sp), notat b, vocat Put.; 8. 1 lunc Eprium b Put, ltere
proprium H 3 8. 11 haberemus H, labemus b; 812 angustia ereptum H, au-
