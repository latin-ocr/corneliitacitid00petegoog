arbitrary and irresponsible emendation, enabled him to produce a text
which presents many points 01 contrast to that of Michaelis. Binde, in
a dissertation 10 which reference will be made again (1884), supported
the view of Michaelis, with variations. The latest contribution to the
criticism of the Dialogus has been made by F. Scheuer (1891), who, in
a pamphlet to which all future editors will continue to be indebted,
endeavours to establish the superiority 01 the Y family, though on other
grounds than those on which Baehrens had relied.

Before proceeding to a more detailed consideration 01 the subject 01
the distinguishing characteristica of the two families, it will be advisable
to furnish here a more specific account 01 the various codices to which
reference has already been made.

Of Vaticanus 1862 (A), nothing need be said in addition to what has
already been stated, except that the order 01111 contents is (1) the
Germania, (1) the fragment of Suetonius, and (3) the Dialogus. It
was doubtless 1 faithful copy 01 the manuscript from which it was
transcribed.

The Leidensis (Β), on the other hand, in which the Dialogus comes
first and is followed by the Germania and the Suetonius, presents several
points 01 11111111 and peculiarity. It was long supposed to be the
actual copy made from Enoch's codex by Jovianus Pomanus, the intimate
associate of Alfonso the Magnanimous, who played a large part in the
literary society of the Naples 01 his day ¹. It is now admitted, however,
that B is not the original apographon 01 Fontanus, but a copy 01 11. It
differs considerably from A, though it is impossible now to say how 111
the difference is attributable to the changes introduced by Pontanus him·
seli, and how far 10 the copyist 01 Β. Pontanus is known to have been an
elegant and accurate scholar, and he no doubt incorporated many emen-
dations in the textas he transcribed it. Moreover, the scribe sometimes
makes corrections in his own hand, 101111 01 which are right, while others
are wrong ⁸. Lastly, the whole was subsequently revised by another hand,
cited as b, the author 01 which is generally supposed to have had other
