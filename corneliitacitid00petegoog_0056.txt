THE INTERLOCUTORS AND THEIR PARTS. xliii

clarescit (36. 2)ῑο In chs. 36 and 37 his main point is clearly and
distinctly stated. Just as afterwards in cha 40 and 41 the supe-
riority of republican eloquence is fully recognized (40.8 mgna illa et
notabilis eloquentia . . . tulit stne dubio aabntiorern eloquentiam 41. 22
summa illa laus et gloria in eloquentia: cp. 37. 3), so in these opening
chapters (as also in ch. 38) the speaker sets forth clearly the disad-
vantages that were bound up with a state of things favourable to the
production of great orators: illa perturbatione ac lieentia . . . mentis
omnebus et moderatore uno carentibus . . . turbidis et inqueitis temporibus.
Nothing of this need be taken as censure; the speaker knows the differ-
ence between peace and war (37. 32), and can appreciate the former
without failing to recognize that the latter is the best training-school of
soldiers. But, unlike Messalla, Maternus does not believe that a return
of such political conditione is either practicable or desirable. It may
be impossible now to realize again the magna et notabilis eloquentia that
was the glory of the republic‚ and for which she paid so high a price
(36. ι4; 40. 25). Things have altogether changed Orators are of less
consequence now than they used to be, and eloquence has to content
herself with a contracted sphere (cp. annisis forensium causarum angus-
tiis, 4. 8). But Maternus can at least console himself by utilizing the
advantages of his own peaceful times, and devoting himself to the
pursuits of a learned leisure (cp. 4 ad fin. sanctiorem ellam et augus·
tuorem eloquentiam colam). High oratorical renown and settled repose are
incompatible with each other: therefore while recognizing the superiority
of the eloquence which was nurtured on the disorder of former times, let
every one be thankful for peace and quietness-and make the best use
he can of his talenta and opportunities. ¹
