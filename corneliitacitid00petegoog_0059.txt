xlvi INTRODUCIION.

in repute to the purity, simplicity and naturalness of republican models.
He makes this plain in the course of his estimare and criticism of Seneca
(x. 1, 125 sqq), especially in these well-known words: corruptum et
omnibus ortti's fractum dicendi genus revocare od severiora t'ttdt'cia contendo,
Cicero he held forth tobis pupils as the great model for imitation: hunc
egetur spectemus, troc propositum nodis rit exemplum, ille re preficeret scoot
cui Cicero valde placebit (ib.§ 112). It is not extravagant, therefore, to
assume that Tacitus may have had the benefit of Quintilian’s teaching.
But whether or no he was, or had been, actually a student in his school
at the time when the dialogue is understood to have taken place
(74-75 au), it is impossible to believe that in the interval which elapsed
between that date and the composition of the treatise Tacitus in no way
came under the influence of one who was gradually making himself
apower at Rome. In the year 75, the historiari is understood to have
been only about twenty years of age, and had probably just arrived at the
stage of looking forward to actual practice in the centumviral courts: we
know that it was at this age that his younger contemporary Pliny began ’
his professional work (Epp. v. 8, 8). For the rest, he had attached himself
as an enthusiastic pupil and companion to two of the most famous
counsel of the day, Marcus Aper and Julius Secundus: and his zealous
attendance on these masters (see ch. 2) is described quite in the spirit of
one who knew the value of the recommendation which Quintilian lays
down for the aspiring advocate, oratorem arbi olr'quem, quod opud motoris
fierr‘solebot, delegat quem sequetur, quem thrr'tetur (x. 5, 19). Even if his
preparatory training had been completed by this time, without any assist-
ance from Quintilian, there is still the probability that one who was
evidently so well marked out for a successful career as Tacitus must
have been brought in various ways into contact with the author of the
Institutio. Apart from all opportunities of personal intercourse within
the circle of a congenial literary society, Tacitus may have had recourse
to the great teacher for professional help. Quintilian's pupils were not
all boys. The study and practice of declamation were continued at
Rome into later life. There is an ample interval in the nine or ten years
following nu. 75 for some relationship to have been established, either ·
personal or professional or both, between two of the most interesting
figures in the history of their time.

But however this may be, there' can be no question of Tacitus’s early
appreciation of Cicero, or of the effect of this appreciation on the¹ style of
the Drbtogue. One needs only to read a few chapters to recognize the
fact that it differs as much from the artificial, overdone, and affectedly
incisive style which was popular at the time as from that which Tacitus
