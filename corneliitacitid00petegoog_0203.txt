poterat. Magna eloquentia, sicut flamma, materia alitur et

5 horum quoque temporum oratores ea consecuti sunt quae com-
posita et quieta et beata re publica tribui fas erat, tamen illa
perturbatione ac licentia plura sibi adsequi videbantur, cum,
mixtis omnibus et moderatore uno carentibus, tantum quisque
orator saperet quantum erranti populo persuadere poterat.

2. Magna eloquentia. This is the

passage in connexion with which William
Pitt is recorded to have proved his ready
skill at off-hand translation. Some one
having pronounced it nntranslateable, he
came ont with the following: ‘It is with
eloquence as with a flame. It requires
fuel to feed it, motion to excite it, and it
brightens as it bums’ (Stanhope's Life of
Pitt, vol. iii. p. 413). cp. Cic. Brut. §93
omnis illa vis et qnasi flamma exstin-
ruitur.
k 3. motibus. The use of the plural
seems to favour John’s explanation that
the reference is, in the case of eloquence,
to political disturbances (cp. illa pertur-
batione, below) z in the case of fire, it will
be rather to deliberate stirring and poking,
than to the fanning of titful breezes. The
commentators generallyexplain ‘motus'of
mental excitement, comparing the Bmtus
l. c. (of Galba) ‘dein cnm otiosus (i. e. in
the calm that followed his outburst of
feeling) stilum prehenderat motusque
omnis animi tauquam ventus hominem
defecerat, flaccescebat oratio.’

clarescit. This verb is more com-
monly used metaphoricnlly, eg. Anu.
xi. 16, 13 (of becoming famous): cp.
however Anu. xv. 37, 13 quantum iuxta

calescit, and also the frequent collocation
‘excitare et inflammare (e. g. Cic. pro
Pomp. a: de Hamsp. resp. 1,19). But
this is altogether unnecessary: Pitt's ‘it
briggtens as it bums' may be allowed to
stan .

Eadem ratio, ‘the same conditions'
From in nostra quoque civitate, we may
infer that the speaker has been treatiug of
Greek eloquence,-probably of the golden
age of Attlc oratory.

7. videbantur, sc. antiqui oratores, as
is evident from the antithesis between
lorum . . . temporum aud illa perturba-
batione. There is an emphasis on sibi,
which goes with adsequi : ‘the personal
advantages which they saw open to them
were greater then than now.’
