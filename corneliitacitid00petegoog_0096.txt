MANUSCRIPTS. “ lxxxiii

The result is that the reading which must have stood in the original is
to be found in the MSS. of the Y family more frequently than in AB.
’ But it is important to note that this does not necessarily imply that Υ
was a truer representative than X of the archetype on which they both
‚depended the codex found by Enoch of Ascoli, or of the copy which he
may have taken from that codex. On the contrary, the conscientious
accuracy with which the more unleamed copyist of X, as represented
especially by A, followed the lines of his original is a guarantee of the
fact that, where the two families disagree, the divergence is often due to
improvement and emendation on the part of the members of theY family.
The following lists have been drawn out with the view of making clear
the nature of the discrepancies: in any final judgment it is the character
and probable origin of a particular reading, quite as much as the
comparative accuracy of the two traditions, that ought to be carefully
examined. Where Α and B give a distinctive and characteristic reading,
there is a reasonable certainty that they are reproducing what was before
‘them; on the other hand, similar readings in the Y family are often due
to the emendation of some individual scribe.

Leaving out of account, in the meantime, such comparatively unim-
portant variations as the pronouns (eg. illa . . . rita, iis . . . hir, dte), as
well· as all cases where the discrepancy seems to have arisen from the
misunderstanding or the neglect of compendia, and the not inconsiderable
number of instances which must be classed as doubtful, we may select
the following as affording striking tests of the two different traditions,

In the following places, the right reading is certainly preserved by AB,
sometimes re-inforced by D or H, or by both :-

12. 10 et malis moribus ABDH et ex malis moribus Ev2ca
21. 17 regule A, regule BD (for illae EV2CA
reliquas, see ad loc.)
25. 1 praescnptam a te ABD et prescriptam E, perscriptam et C', prae·
scnsstam et Vp), a te pretermittam H
41.12 obscuriorque ABDH η obscurior EV2CA

Probability is strongly infavour of the X family also in the following
instances, though many of them depend on compendia which might
easily have been misunderstood or' neglected :-

9. 5 deinceps AB deinde EV2CADH
5. 2 moderati ABE modesti C Dav,H

Here it was probably the omission of the syllable erin the original that
· gave rise to the reading of the Y class: cp.l'l. 17 fateretur (below);„also
