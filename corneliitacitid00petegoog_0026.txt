THE QUESTION OF AUTHORSHIP AND DATE. xiii

irorn July 1, 74, to July 1, 75. According to this calculation, the con-
versation recorded in the Duizlogue must have taken place in that year: if
on the very anniversary of Cicero’s death (iu tluuc dum), on December 7,
no. 74. But this gives, strictly speaking, only 116 years as the interval
which has elapsed since the death of Cicero, not 120 years as stated in
the text. Again, in enumerating the reigns of which the sum total is
composed, the manuscripts give 59 for Augustus, 23 ior Tiberius, 4 for
Caligula, 28 ior Claudius and Nero, 1 for Galba, Otho, and Vitellius, and
6for Vespasian: atotal oi 121 years This last discrepancy need not
be considered of much weight, especially in view oi the approximate
character of some oi the constituent factors, as, ior example, prope
quadriennium Gai: it is sufficiently accurate ior the speaker’s purpose.
A more serious difficulty consists in the ascription of 59 years to
Augustus, when as a matter oi fact he ought to be credited with only
., 56 (Α. υ. c. ¹711-767). Some bave proposed to leave this standing, as
an error of the writer or the speaker (cp. 34 ad fin, where we have nono
decano for uuo et nr'cesimo) ; but it is hardly likely that a figure doubtless
so well-known would have been incorrectly given. Lipsius therefore
changed nouem to sex, and'all editors follow his lead. But this gives only
118 years as the total, a consideration which has led to the obvious sug-
gestion that centum etdnodevigznti should be substituted in the text sor
centum et viginti Itis usually considered more probable, however,
(especially in view of the repetition oi the figure at the end of ch. 24),
that centum et viginti is given as a round number, summing up in a
general way the duration oi the constituent principates as stated in what
goes before. In any case, it is impossible to make centnm et viginti
square exactly with sexta statio in the sense of the sixth year of
Vespasian's reign.

The numbers have in all probability been tampered with by some
reader who was anxious to correct the speaker's arithmetic: this is almost
certainly the origin of the unhistorical nonem et quinquaginta for the
duration oi the reign of Augustus. If we suppose that Aper dated Ves-
pasian’s reign from the time of his arrival in Rome, in the middle oi the
year 70, instead ol from July 1, 69, we must follow most editors in
tixing on nn. 75 as the year in which the dialogue was held. This
would give, on the inclusive method ofreckoning, 118 years as the exact in-
terval (43-1- 75): afigure with which the detailed enumeration corresponds,
ii we adopt Lipsius’s emendation Statue sex et qninquaginta annos.
On this explanation also centum et viginti must be either a round number
or a mistake for centum et duodeuiginti. Something might be said in
favour of the year no. 76, ii we were to make three emendations on the
