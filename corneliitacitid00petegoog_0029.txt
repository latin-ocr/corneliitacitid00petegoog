xvi INTRODUCTION.

birth his biographers have been able to arrive approximately by a process
of inference. He tells ‚us in the Histories (i. 1) that his official career
began under Vespasian, and that he received promotion from both Titus
and Domitian. This must mean that he was quaestor in the first-
mentioned reign, and either tribune or aedile under Titus: while we
know that he held the praetorship in nn. 88. Titus reigned from June
79 to September 8r; and, as it is improbable that more than one year
intervened between his tenure ol the two lower offices, we may infer that
Tacitus was quaestor in either 78 or 79. A necessary qualification for
this office was that a candidate should have attained his twenty-fifth year, .
so that we may take it that the year of his birth must be fixed at nn. 53
or 54. This would make him about twenty at the date at which he was
present as a listener when the conversation reported in the Dialogue took
· place: atime of life which agrees admirably with the phrase obvenit

admodum. tf, with others, we adopt theyear 56 as the date of his

l birth, he may have been two years younger: and either supposition suits ⁴

p the description which he gives ol himself as a follower of two of the most .
famous ol contemporary pleaders, Aper and Secundus (2. 6).

The next point to be settled, on the theory that Tacitus wrote the
Dzblogue‚ is the date at which it was composed and published. Here the

i views ol the critics diverge, as we have already seen, very considerably.
Many of them have given undue weight to the passage in the Agraiolo in Α
which Tacitus refers to Domitian's reign as a period during which ‘the

” young have passed to old age, wr'th closed lips, and the old almost to the
very goal and term oi lise ².' From the phrase per sz'lentzicm it has been
inferred that Tacitus cannot have written anything of any kind in the
reign of Domitian, and the conclusion drawn hasbeen that the Dz'ologuo
must have been composed either in the reign of Titus or else after
Domitian's death, about the same time as the other minor works. But in “
the passage under consideration, Tacitus is speaking asa historiari who
(though he may have been industriously collecting material in the evil
days which had now come to a close) is hailing a happier era as per·
mitting him at length to break the silence into which he had been
coerced. It is quite conceivable that, whether published or not at the
time of composition, sucha work as the Dz'ologue might have been written

’ iu the earlier and brighter years of Domitian's reign. Τοο much has no
doubt been made of the necessity of postulating a considerable interval
between the time at which the conversation took place and the time at
which the treatise was composed, in order to account for the use ol the
