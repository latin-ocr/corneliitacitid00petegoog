MANUSCRIPTS. lxxi

codices beside him, and even printed editions, such as those of Puteolanus
and Rhenanus. The general agreement between the variants introduced
by b and the text of the Harleiouus would seem to point, however, to
a different explanation: see p. lxxix.

The common derivation of these two codices (A and B) is obvious
from the fact that the end of the twenty-fifth chapter of the Germania is
displaced in both. Their original (Χ) was probably written by a scribe
who was not so skilful in resolving compendia as the writer of Y: they
each contain corruptions which must be attributed to the writer of X,
sesing that in the corresponding places the members of the Y family give
the text correctly. An excellent example of this, as well as of the
tendeney to emendation on the part of B, occurs in the Suetonius frag·
ment, 127. 30, 3 (Reifferscheid), where we have ypseu A, ipseum B,
conspectu ECDH, for asperi: cp. ib. 126. 30, 15 personalem AB, pro-
consulem E, pcons. H, procos. D, porcos C. From the tradition of A and
B, itis a much easier task to restore the text of X than it is to infer from
the other existing codices what must have stood in Y. The copyist of
A followed his original with the most scrupulous care, and made very
few changes: hence A must be regarded as superior to B in literal
accuracy of reproduction. In doubtful cases, the adhesion of the repre-
sentatives of Y to the tradition of either A or B may be taken as conclusive
of what must have originally stood in X.

’ For the Y family, Michaelis cited, in his critical edition (1868), the
readings of the Farnesrbnus (C), Vaticanus 1518 (D), Vaticanus 4498 (A),
and Ottobombnus (E): to these must be added the Harla'auus (H), the
l'ondobonensis cecat (V), and the Wndobonensis occx1 (V,).

The Farnesranus (C) is one of the MSS. which must derive indirectlys
except for the minor works, from the Second Medicean. It contains
Annals xi-xvi: Ηίεί. i—v, the Dialoguo, the Germania and the fragment
of Suetonius. For its relation to other existing MSS. of the historical
boola, see Fumeaux’s Annols, vol. ii. pp. a, 3, where it is classed with
the second group of codices from one of which Spira is believed to have
printed his edr'tio princeps. The addition of the minor works proves that
it is not earlier than the latter part of the fifteenth century.

The two Vatican MSS. 1518 (D) and 4498 (A) have this in common,
that they contain some minor writings, in addition to Tacitus and
Suetonius. Their contents are as follows: in D we have, after Porphyrio's
commentary on Horace, and alife of Persius, with the commentary
of Cornutus, (a) the Suetonius fragment, (b) the Dialogus, and (c) the
Germania. The Suetonius comes first in Δ, followed by Pseudo-Plinii
