author of the note was not the copyist os that late manuscript, but the
scholar who wrote the Harlctirnus, where it will be found in the rubric‚

Ἰ Though it is impossible to say how the MS. now in the British
Museum came into the hands of Ambrose Bonwiclre, we are fortunately
able to determine the name oi its first owner, and consequently its
approximate date. On the first iolio os the Suetonius fragment appears
a coat of arms which Mr. Wamer succeeded in identifying as those of
John Tiptost‚ the literary Earl of Worcester (d. 1470). Tiptolt acted as
ambassador to the Pope and Council of Mantua in 1459, and returned
Ι to England towards the end ol 1460, aiter using the opportunity afforded
by his residence in Italy to get together a valuable library². In Florence
he was taken iu hand by the bookseller Vespasiano ⁸, and attended
incognito a lecture by the renowned Argyropulos. This would be about

’ the time when Enoch's discovery had brought the Dzirlogue and the

Suetonius fragment, as well as the Germania, to Florence, and when
scholars were busy in emending a text that was admittedly corrupt.
What more natural than that the English collector should have wished
to secure a copy in which, however, the first two treatises were alone
included, owing to the similarity of their subject matter? The upper limit
sor the date of Tiptoit's acquisition oi the copy in question is fixed by the
time of his sojourn in Italy: the lower limit is determined by the date of
his execution, October 18, 1470, aster which his arms would not have
been added to the codex⁴. Another factor in the calculation is the
