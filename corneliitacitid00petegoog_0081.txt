lxviii INTRODUCTION.

a more or less exact transcript 01 his original: the copyist of Y, on the
other hand, brought greater scholarship to bear on his task, and allowed
himself more freedom in executing it. The X family is represented
now by the Vaticanus 1862 (A) and the Leidensis (Β). The Y family
includes the Farncsianas (C), Vaticanus 1518 (D), Vaticanus 4498 ( ),
the Ottobonzonus (Ε), the Wndoboncnsis nocxr (1,), the Harlezanus (H),
and the Wndobonensz's 00011 (V) ¹.

The cdr‘tio princeps 01 the works of Tacitus, which did not include the
as yet undiscovered first six books of the Annals, is understood to have
been printed ironr a codex which must have derived ultimately frorn the
manuscript now known as the Second Medicean (Laar. 68, 1), generally
believed to have been written at Monte Casino in the latter 11111 01 the
eleventh century. It was published by Vendelin de Spira at Venice in
1470. Several MSS. of the last books 01 the Annals and the Irlzitorics
must then have been available, some oi thern copied, no doubt, as soon
as the Second Medicean had passed, at the time 01 Niccolo’s (1111111437),
from private keeping into the library 01 the Convent 01 St. Mark‚ after-
wards incorporated with the Laurentian Library at Florence. Bnt none 01
thern contained the minor workst. For these Spira must have been
indebted to some copy oi Enoch's find, by which the Germania-and the
Dialogus, at least, were re-united to the parent stem from which they had
so long been dissevered. Such codices as the Farnesranus (C) and the
Vindobonensis (V) must have resulted from the wish to combine Enoch’s
discovery with the already known works. It was from a codex 01 this
class (said to have been at the time in the Library 01 St. Mark at Venice)
that Spira printed: astar as coneems the Dialogus, it must have embodied
many 01 the readings and emendations 01 which the earliest trace is
probably to be found in the hitherto neglected Harlaanus (H). Then
came the edition of Puteolanus (Milan, 1475), in which many 01 the
mistakes 01 the edito princeps were corrected. Puteolanus is generally
understood not to have had the assistance 01 any manuscript (Michaelis,
