MANUSCRIPTS. lxix

Pref. p. i); but, though this may bc true 61 the rest 61 his book, it is
probable that he was acquainted with the text of the Dcologue as given
in the Horln'anus, and several instances 61 true readings hitherto ascribed
16 Puteolanus which are anticipated in the British Museum codex will
be recorded in the commentary. Similar emendations and interpolations
are to be found also in the editions 61 Beroaldus (1514) and Beatus
Rhenanus (1519 and 1533). By employing the Forncrronus (C),
Lipsius put the text 61 Tacitus on a new basis in his great edition
61 1574, the popularity of which may be estimated from the fact that no
fewer than ten re·issues of the work, revised by Lipsius himself, appeared
at Antwerp and Leyden between 1574 and 1607. The last of these
embodied the improvements made on the text by Pichena: and about
the same time the labours 61 Muretus, Pithon, and Acidalius combined
16 purge the Dcologuc in particular 61 many of the blemishes which even
then remained upon it. The edition 61 Gronovius (Amsterdam, 1671 and
1685) does not indicate any independent advance, For the Dc‘ologuc,
Brotier went back to the Mss, and used the four Vatican codices (1862,

1618, 1964, and 4498) without, however, recognizing the supreme ‘

importance 61 Vct. 1862 (Α). The codex Forncsconur (C) still held the
iirst place, not only in Brotier's eyes, but in those 61 Heumann (Gottingen,
1719), Schulre (Leipzig, 1788), Dronke (Coblenz, 1828), Orelli (Zdrich,
1830), and Bekker (1831). Next, Egger coliated the codex Porr'sr'cnsis
7773, which, however, will be shown below to be a mere copy 61 the
Horlczonus (Η) Iu his edition of 1841, Hess gives the readings of the
Vc'ndoboncnrci (11) 11 reported by Schubart. In the same year came Tross's
collation 61 the very important codex laciensis (Β), which had formerly
belonged to Perizonius Of this codex, Ritter made a fresh collation for
his complete edition 61 Τ1611111(1848),111111111111111111111111161111116111111Ι
above the Farncsronrcs (C). But almost at the same time the Vaticanus
1861 (Α) begins to emerge. Nipperdey was the first to demonstrate its
superiority (Hali. Lot. Zeti. 1846), and in his edition of the Germanic
(1847), Massmann suspected that it must stand on at least a footing
of equality with Β.ι The same line was taken by Reifferscheid in his
Quacsrones Suefom‘anoc (111 especially pp. 409 sqq.), and lastly, by
Michaelis, in his critical· edition of the Dz‘ologue (1868). Michaelis
had examined Α161 himseli in the year 1858, and had come to the
conclusion that it was ‘integrior' than B. To A and B he adheres
closely, as against the Y family of MSS. Baehrens, on the other hand,
constructed his critical edition (1881) on the theory that the Y family
contained a truer tradition than that of which AB are the representa-
tives: and this theory, taken along with his own tendencies towards
