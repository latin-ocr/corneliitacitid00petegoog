and Head Master of Merchant Taylors from 1686 till he was dismissed
in 1691 for not having taken thenath of allegiance ¹. The MS. was
bought along with six others, for the sum 21227 72, from W. Bowyer,
the printer, who acted as Bonwicke’s executor after his death on Oct. 22,
2722. The date of the transactionis recorded as Sept. 11, 1725 ².

The Harlezbnus (H) is mentioned by Roth in his edition of Suetonius
(p. lxi), and Michaelis derived his account of it from him. Baehrens also
refers to it in his critical commentary, but only to deny it any authority.
He ranks it after the Parzst'ensis 7773 and the Wiedobonensis (V,)‚ and
describes all three as ‘of very recent date and vilely interpolated'—lrbri
qurilam recentissimi foedissimaque interpolati (p. 45). I shall be able to
show, however, that the Harletbnus takes us back to within a few years of
Enoch’s discovery, and that the Parisiensis, which was used by Pithon and
included by Michaelis among the MSS. on which he founded his critical
edition (1868), was directly copied from it at a date considerably later.
The Porrsiensis need not be referred to again in any discussion of the
text of the Drologue. It has not, and ought never to have been allowed,
any independent value whatever. Perhaps the clearest proof tlrat it is
amere copy of H may be found in the fact that at 40.9 it omits the
words [libertatem uocabant comes seditionum effrenati] These words form
a single line in H, and were inadvertently passed over 27 the copyist.
The late date of the Parmensis is indicated by what Pithon says in his
Paris edition (1580): in husos autem dialogi cdt'ti‘one, praeter exemplar in
Italzb ante aliquot annos descriptam, montino nobis adiumento fuit Lipsii
nostri industrio, 822. 12 212 commentary on 15. 2 22 reports a marginal
note Eodem verba sunt Petroni: ‘in exemplari Italico ad h. l. adscriptum
fuit Eodem verba sunt Petroni et sane quaedam initio Satyrici Petroniani
quae huius disputationis aliquot locis valde consentanea sunt’ This
enabled Egger³ to identify the Parisiensis as the codex used by Pithon,
and thus to solve a question to which he alludes as ‘lis aviris doctis
agitata': he found traces of the words eodem verba sunt Petronii in the
